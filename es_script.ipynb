Whether you’ve been teaching for just a few years or an entire lifetime, being an educator is in your blood. That’s something that doesn’t go away when you retire — and neither does your opportunity to become part of the Meemic family. Bus Drivers Without bus drivers there would be a lot of empty classrooms. In addition to getting kids safely to school on time, bus drivers stay in tune with their students.

That’s why Meemic places a high value on the health and well-being of bus drivers across the country. See how Meemic makes auto insurance for school bus drivers easy when they’re off the clock. Why Educators Choose Meemic for Car Insurance With Meemic, your role as a teacher or educator means your auto insurance coverage includes some valuable discounts and benefits, including: Understanding Your Auto Coverage You rely on your car and you can rely on Meemic to help protect it. Yourlocal Meemic agentcan help you understand your options for auto insurance coverage: Personal Injury Protection (PIP) helps cover expenses for injuries in an auto accident. PIP coverage is the largest part of your auto insurance premium and usually makes up about half of your total cost. If you’re at fault for an accident, this coverage pays for the value of another person’s injury or damage to another person’s property up to the elected/purchased policy limits. If another driver is at fault in an accident and doesn’t have enough coverage to pay for damages, this coverage will help with your costs. This coverage helps pay for damage to your vehicle caused by a rollover or contact with another vehicle or object regardless of who’s at fault. This coverage helps pay for damage to your vehicle not caused by a collision, such as theft, fire or flood. Interested in Becoming a Meemic Member? Frequently asked questions How do I know what coverage I need? Talk to yourlocal Meemic agentto help you determine which coverages and amounts fit your situation. How much coverage should I purchase?

We want to help you save as much as possible on your policy. Here are some ideas to get you behind the wheel with affordable car insurance in Michigan: Drive Safely As a general rule, safe drivers pay less for car insurance. The longer you drive without an accident or major citation, the lower your car insurance premium is likely to be. Also, the less you drive, the less likely you are to end up in an accident – so consider public transportation, riding your bike or even carpooling with another educator or school staff member. Research Before You Buy a New Car Did you know that not all cars cost the same to insure? If you are planning to purchase a new vehicle, be sure to do your research before you buy to avoid any surprises when you see your new rate. Certain makes and models with proven track records for safety can be less expensive, while others can cause an increase in insurance costs. To get started, check out theInsurance Institute for Highway Safety’s top safety picks. Purchase Multiple Policies We call it bundling – but you can just call it saving. When you combine more than one insurance policy with Meemic, your overall costs will go down. We provide all sorts of affordable insurance for educators like you, so consider us for home insurance, car insurance, boat insurance and more. Ask About Available Discounts for Teachers and Educators The more we know about you, the more ways we can find to help you save. We’ll help you identify insurance discounts based on your car, your life and even your state of residence. Ask us about discounts for safe driving, multiple vehicles, paying your policy in full and more, including some exclusive to educators. Choose a Higher Deductible If you’re a good driver, a higher deductible might make sense. Your deductible is the amount you agree to pay out-of-pocket before your policy benefits apply. You can set your deductible to an amount you’re comfortable with when choosing a policy. The higher your deductible, the lower your car insurance premiums will be. *Discount applies to select coverages only. **Certain qualifications and restrictions apply.

If you're an active driver on an auto insurance policy with AAA or Meemic, you're eligible for theAAADriveMobile App program.  How do I enroll? Enrolling inAAADriveis easy: How do I get started with AAADrive? Once steps 1 through 4 are completed, you are ready to start usingAAADriveand sharing your driving data. What are the requirements to generate a AAADrive Score? When is my driving data used to generate a AAADrive UBI Score? For AAADrive participants in Florida, Georgia, Michigan, and Tennessee. For AAADrive participants in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin Why do I need to accept AAADrive permission requests? The following permission requests must be set as directed for theAAADriveapp to record and share your driving data: Does the AAADrive app require an internet connection? You need internet access forAAADriveto process and score any new trips. The Internet connection can be through a Wi-Fi network or a cellular network. If your smartphone isn't connected to the internet when new trip data is ready to be uploaded or newly scored trips are ready to be downloaded, don't worry. The trip data upload/download will happen automatically when the Internet connection is available. You don't need an active internet connection to record trip data or view the results of previous trips. Does the AAADrive app need to be open to collect my driving data? No, theAAADriveapp does not need to be open to collect your driving data.   TheAAADriveapp works in the background and collects your driving data when a drive is detected. However, your mobile device needs to be turned on during your trips to collect your driving data. What driving score and trip information is displayed in the AAADrive app? AAADriveshows you the following information about your driving score and trips: Dashboard and Score section: Trips section: How does my driving affect my score? AAADriveassesses your driving performance by considering the following factors to give you an overall score out of 100: How does my AAADrive Score affect my policy premium? Here's how your driving scores are determined inAAADrive: Why are all my individual scoring (stars) factors higher than my overall trip score (stars)? While theAAADriveapp displays individual scoring factors like Speeding, Phone Use, and Hard Braking to determine your overall score, there are other factors not shown in the app that can also influence it. One such factor is Phone Screen Interaction. If you touch your phone screen while driving, it can have a negative impact on your overall score How is hard braking measured? TheAAADriveapp records a hard braking event when you suddenly reduce your speed, like slamming on the brakes in a lower-speed zone or significantly decreasing speed on the highway. If you frequently engage in hard braking, even at lower speeds, it may indicate behaviors such as tailgating or not paying attention, which can contribute to accidents. Why was I penalized for hard braking when I couldn't avoid it? TheAAADriveapp only measures how hard and for how long you brake; it doesn't know the specific circumstances of each event. Your overall score factors in the frequency (or rate) of hard braking events. Occasional hard braking in unavoidable situations doesn't significantly impact your score. However, keep in mind that you may lose stars for individual trips, as the stars reflect what happened on that specific trip. How is speeding measured? TheAAADriveapp detects a speeding event when the user is driving above the posted speed limit for the subject road. I was on the highway but it said I was speeding on the frontage road. What do I do? Sometimes, theAAADriveapp may have difficulty distinguishing between the highway and the frontage road adjacent to it. This can lead to the app assessing your speed based on the frontage road instead of the highway. If you believe your speed limit for a specific road is incorrect, you can click that specific event to submit a request to evaluate this event and  describe what the speed limit should be. If we can validate the accuracy of the information, we can reach out to you to see if you want to remove the trip from scoring. What counts as “Phone Distraction”? TheAAADriveapp identifies Phone Distraction as a form of distracted driving through two methods: It is important to note thatAAADrivedoesn't analyze the content on your phone, but it can detect when the phone is being handled or tapped, which increases the risk of an accident. Why was I penalized for phone use when my car was stopped? Even if your car is stationary when you pick up your phone, theAAADriveapp records a phone use event if you begin to drive while still holding it. However, the distraction penalty applies only for the period when you are using the phone while your car is in motion. If a passenger uses my phone while I’m driving, will my score be affected? Occasional phone use by a passenger, such as selecting music for a single trip, shouldn't have a significant impact on your overall score.AAADrivefocuses more on long-term driving behavior trends rather than isolated events. Why was I penalized for phone use when my passenger was using my phone? TheAAADriveapp does not differentiate between a driver using the phone and a passenger using it. To ensure your score isn't affected, we recommend passengers refrain from using the driver's phone. If a trip is recorded while you're a passenger (not driving), simply manually reclassify the trip as \"passenger.\" Similarly, if you're the driver but another individual in the vehicle is actively using your phone, manually reclassify the trip as \"driving - passenger used phone.\" This helps maintain the accuracy of your driving data and score. How does the app know if I am a driver or a passenger? Over time, theAAADriveapp learns your driving behaviors and common routes, helping it determine whether you were the driver or a passenger for a given trip. To assist the app in this learning process, we recommend that you review and update your trip classifications for your first ten or fifteen trips. Here's how you can classify your trip classification: Your scores should be recalculated immediately, although it may take a short time for your Streaks to update. How does the app determine the start and end of a trip? TheAAADriveapp utilizes a number of different phone sensor inputs to identify whether a drive counts as one or more trips. For instance, it distinguishes between being stopped in traffic and being stopped because the trip has ended. It's important to note that if a single trip was recorded as two trips in error, it won't affect your score. What is the gray line that appears on my trip route? TheAAADriveapp may take up to a minute or two after a trip starts to detect driving and begin collecting location data. During this period, the app calculates an inferred path back to your last known location. You'll see this inferred path displayed as a gray line on the trip route. Why does the app say that it is recording a trip when I am not in a vehicle? In rare cases, you may encounter a \"Recording\" message in the app even when you're not on a trip. This can happen because the phone registers changes that resemble the movement of a vehicle. Although the app displays \"Recording\" in these instances, no valid trip recordings are generated, scored, or displayed in the app. However, if one of these trips does appear in the app, you have the option to change the trip label so that it is not scored. What is My Group? My Group is an optional feature that enables users to share their location, driving trends, and trip information with their family, friends, or other group of users. At a high level, from the driver’s point of view: How do I access My Group? My Group can be accessed either through the My Group card on the dashboard or through the My Group line item on the More menu screen. When the user is not in a group, the dashboard card shows a prompt to share scores and trips with a group and a “Go” button to get started. When the user is in a group, the corresponding dashboard card will show all members in the group. How do I set up My Group? A user can create a group and invite other family members or friends to the group. To do this, tap the “Go” button on the My Group dashboard card. On the next screen, choose the option to “Create” a group. Once the group is created, you will be brought to the main My Group screen with a map, and it will show a group containing only your user. How do I invite users to My Group? Whoever creates a group is the admin for the group, and only the admin can invite other users to it. To invite users to your group, tap the button at the bottom of the main My Group screen. This will bring you to the invite screen, which displays a code that can be shared with other users to join your group. Tap the ‘share code’ button to send a pre-populated invite message with email, text messaging, or other apps. You can edit the message before sending. The code can be used by app users not already in a group. You will be able to see each user that joins your group in the listing on the main group screen. The admin will also receive a push notification when a new member joins their group. How do I join My Group? Tap on the My Group dashboard card or the More menu item. On the next screen, choose the option to “Join” a group and input the invite code you received. When a valid code is entered, you will be brought to the main My Group screen with a map, and it will show the group you have joined. What information can I see about My Group? The main group screen shows the list of members in your group with their current overall driving score, as well as their recent location displayed on a map (unless they have turned off location and trip sharing). Tapping on a group member brings you to the member detail screen. This screen allows you to see the user’s scored distance, scored trip count, trip list, trends, and Streaks. Tapping through trips in the trip list will take you to a map with details for each trip. Note that up to the last 30 days of trips are visible for each user, regardless of when that member joined the group. If a user has disabled location and trip sharing, there will not be trips available in that user’s list. How is a My Group user’s location determined? My Group members can see the list of all members and the last known location for each member. The last known location is based on the app’s trip detection functionality — it does not track the location of the user in real time. Location is indicated with a pin on the map, with the picture or initial of the member. Tapping the pin will bring up more information including the trip end time. How do I stop sharing location and trip data within My Group? At the bottom of the main group screen, tap ‘Stop Sharing’ and then hit ‘Confirm’ to cease sharing of your location and trip data with the group. Once you stop sharing, group members will not be able to see your last known location on the group map nor will they be able to see any trips you have taken on your member detail screen. Note that you will not see this data within the group screen either (but you will of course still see it within other parts of the app). Can I start sharing location and trip data again after I’ve stopped sharing in My Group? Yes, you can start sharing again by tapping on the “Start Sharing” button at the bottom of the main group screen and then hitting “Confirm” in the following popup. Once you start sharing, group members will be able to see your last known location on the group map and any recent trips (up to the last 30 days of trips) on your member detail screen. How do I leave My Group? All members have the ability to remove themselves from the group at any point. Use the Leave/Delete a group button at the upper right corner of the main group screen to do so. As an admin, how do I remove users from My Group? To remove a member from their group, the admin can go to the main group list screen and swipe left on that member they want to remove. After swiping left, the admin can tap the red button to confirm the removal. Are there limits on My Group invitation code use? Invite codes expire after 10 uses, or after one week, whichever comes first. Can I be in more than one My Group at once? No, a user may only be in one group at a time. If a user is already in a group, they must leave that group before joining a new group.

USAGE BASED INSURANCE (“UBI”) SCORE An initial rating adjustment for participating in the AAADrive Program may be applied to your policy when we are notified of your willingness to enroll in the Program in accordance with the rules, rates, and telematics model on file with the state insurance department where your policy is issued. To maintain this potential rating adjustment, AAADrive Users must download, register, and begin sharing AAADrive driving data within 15 days of enrollment. Any active driver enrolled into AAADrive who is either initially opted in, actively sharing driving data, or has achieved the minimum driving data requirements for a UBI Score is considered a participant in the AAADrive Program. UBI Driver Household Participation percentage is determined by the number of drivers who are participating in AAADrive divided by the number of active drivers on the policy. The requirements of sharing driving data through AAADrive app to obtain and/or maintain a UBI Score may vary based on the rules, rates, and telematics model on file with the state insurance department where your policy is issued. For your AAADrive driving data to be used to calculate a UBI Score, you must record at least 5 trips and 400 miles over the past 91 days. All drivers on a policy who have achieved the minimum UBI Score driving data requirements will have their UBI Scores averaged to determine a Household UBI Score that will be applied as a rating factor to the personal passenger automobiles listed on the policy. The AAADrive Household UBI Score along with the UBI Driver Household Participation percentage are used to determine a rating factor and will adjust policy premium in accordance with the rules, rates, and telematics model on file with the state insurance department where your policy is issued. This could result in an increase or decrease to your auto policy premium. In addition to the AAADrive UBI Score that is generated after sufficient data collection, the AAADrive app will display a 14 day score that reflects Users recent driving behavior to show trends and inform a driver how to improve their driving habits. This two-week score is never used for calculation of your AAADrive UBI Score that is a part of rating. Once a participant meets the driving data requirements and a UBI Score is generated, the UBI Score will be set for the duration of the policy, including future renewals, unless a driver provides the minimum driving data requirements for an updated UBI score. The UBI score assigned will be used for that driver, in the current and future policies that the same driver is active. 9. DISCONTINUING USE OF AAADRIVE You may discontinue use of AAADrive at any time by notifying us, signing out, or uninstalling the AAADrive Software. This will prevent further information from being collected and submitted to us. If at any point you stop use of the AAADrive Software, your policy premium may be adjusted as a result of not meeting the AAADrive driving data requirements. If at the time you discontinue use of the AAADrive Software you already have a UBI Score, that UBI Score will continue to be applied to your current and future policies, including renewals, for rating purposes. If a participant who has discontinued use of AAADrive would like to generate a new UBI score, then the participant will need to re-enroll in the Program. 10. DEACTIVATING AAADRIVE Deactivations may happen via Policy transactions that include but are not limited to manually opting out from AAADrive mobile program, being removed from or becoming ineligible for an ACG auto insurance policy, cancelling or rewriting an ACG auto insurance policy, or failing to meet minimum AAADrive driving data requirements for two consecutive terms. Deactivation prevents further AAADrive information from being collected and submitted to us and could adjust your policy premiums. If at the time of deactivation, you already have a UBI Score, that UBI Score will continue to be applied to your current and future policies, including renewals, for rating purposes. If a participant who has been deactivated would like to generate a new UBI score, then the participant will need to re-enroll in the Program. 11. TRANSFERRING AAADRIVE TO ANOTHER SMARTPHONE AAADrive Software must be installed and activated on the smartphone by you when you enroll in the Program. Transferring of the collection of information to a different smartphone is permitted by following the procedure when downloading and activating the AAADrive Software to the new phone. 12.

That’s why Meemic places a high value on the health and well-being of bus drivers across the country. See how Meemic makes auto insurance for school bus drivers easy when they’re off the clock. Understanding Your Home Coverage When you’re juggling responsibilities as both a teacher and a homeowner, understanding your home insurance coverage is crucial. At Meemic, our home insurance policies are designed to give you peace of mind and help provide you with a safety net in case of disaster or emergency. Homeowners insurance helps protect your home from damage caused by fire, hail, wind, theft, or vandalism. Coverage options include, but are not limited to: This coverage protects the structure of your home and separate structures, such as a garage, from damage caused by wind, fire, hail, vandalism and more. This coverage protects your possessions, such as clothing, televisions or furniture, if damaged or stolen.

Coverage options include, but are not limited to: Mobile Home Insurance At Meemic, we also understand the unique insurance needs of mobile homeowners. While there are many crucial differences, insuring a mobile home and your possessions is relatively similar to insuring any other type of home. Much like standalone home insurance, mobile home insurance policies help protect your home and your property from damage and disaster.

Frequently asked questions Does my homeowners insurance protect my possessions? Your home is filled with valuables that carry both monetary and sentimental value, such as jewelry, golf clubs, coins, collectibles and more. We provide coverage options that let you customize your homeowners insurance policy to help ensure that, even when the unexpected occurs, your possessions and livelihood are not at risk. How much home insurance should I have? Your mortgage lender may require you to cover your home for at least the amount of the mortgage, but the better figure to aim for may be the replacement cost. You also need enough liability coverage to protect yourself from lawsuits resulting from your possible negligence. Talk to yourlocal Meemic agentto determine the best policy for your needs. What does property damage cover? In case of fire, lightning, windstorm or hail, property damage coverage helps repair damage to your home and personal property. What’s the difference between replacement cost and market value? In the event of a total loss, replacement cost is the actual cost of materials, labor and debris removal to rebuild your house in the same spot and at the same size. Market value is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a house. The replacement cost of your home and the market value of your home can be two completely different numbers.

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/home-insurance/umbrella-insurance: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Umbrella Insurance If you’re sued for more than the liability limit of your home, auto or boat insurance policy, an umbrella policy can pay the excess damages and legal fees. An umbrella insurance policy can help you protect your savings and the equity you have in your home — or even protect your future earnings. You may not have thought about personal umbrella insurance in the past, but lawsuits are filed more often today and the damage awards are larger than ever before. That means a greater risk of expensive personal liability claims for everyone. We are currently only offering Meemic Insurance to residents in Michigan. Meemic is growing and we hope to provide protection for educators in more states in the near future. Until then, please visit our partners at AAA to receive a quote. What If Your Home or Auto Coverage Isn’t Enough? A personal umbrella policy provides the extra protection you would need if you were sued for more than your current home, auto or boat liability limits, which may only be $100,000 to $300,000. Umbrella policy liability limits are available from $1 million to $5 million to help protect your assets and pay legal expenses. Request a quote or contact a local Meemic agent and find out why umbrella insurance is one of the best values for your insurance dollar. What Is Umbrella Insurance and Do I Need It? Many people don’t know what Umbrella Insurance even is, and most think they don’t need it. What they don’t realize is that their regular insurance only covers so much, and “so much” can end up being very little if crisis strikes. That’s why Umbrella Insurance can really be worth having, because it covers above and beyond the limits of regular policies. What does it cover? What does it not cover? When Should You Consider Umbrella Insurance? If you have a pool on your property, a dog in your home, or a good chunk of money in your savings account, you might want to consider Umbrella Insurance. There are a number of reasons it can help you, especially if you’re physically active, you own properties, or you’re a prominent member in your community. These factors increase your chances of being sued, and having this extra coverage will give you peace of mind, knowing that if anything goes wrong, you’ll be covered past the limits on your regular policies. Still have questions? Find an agent today who can talk you through all the details and help get you covered.

Flood Insurance Coverage Make Sure a Flood Doesn’t Wash Out Your Investment As any eighth-grade science teacher will tell you, flood waters are one of the most damaging forces on earth, with storms causing rising waters both at the shore and inland. Your local Meemic agent will work with you to find affordable flood insurance that will help you clean up, rebuild, and get back on your feet. Why Get Flood Insurance? Everyone, Everywhere Needs a Flood Insurance Policy You can look at flood hazard maps to see the risk levels for your area, but just because you haven’t experienced a flood in the past doesn’t mean you’re safe. Building and development and shifting weather patterns could cause the water to rise. If you’re in a low-risk to moderate-risk area, you still need flood insurance coverage — your rates will still be affordable, and it’s completely worth the peace of mind.

What Does Meemic Stand For? Did you know that Meemic isn’t just a made up name? It actually started as an acronym, and its roots go all the way back to when we were first founded in 1950 in Detroit, Michigan. Back then, our founders, who were also educators, came together to create a company that would offer high-quality, affordable insurance exclusively to their fellow teachers in Michigan, a tradition that still stands today. That’s why M.E.E.M.I.C. originally stood for Michigan Educational Employees Mutual Insurance Company. A lot has changed in nearly 75 years. Today, we serve more than just teachers and offer additional insurance products — including auto, home, boat and umbrella coverage. So, the company that started out as M.E.E.M.I.C., or the Michigan Educational Employees Mutual Insurance Company, is now simply known as Meemic. But the one thing that hasn’t changed, and never will, is that Meemic still stands for and stands with our fellow educators in every community we serve. Who is Eligible to Join Meemic? Teachers, Educators & Staff Meemic Membership extends beyond teachers to include all educational employees, such as: Retired Teachers At Meemic, we truly believe there is no calling more noble or more important than that of the educational community. Whether you’ve been teaching for just a few years or an entire lifetime, being an educator is in your blood. That’s something that doesn’t go away when you retire — and neither does your opportunity to become part of the Meemic family.

See What Our Customers Are Saying For 69 years, Meemic has always been there for us when we needed them. Joyce A. I believe in community. I believe in the give and take of community. I believe in putting my actions where my heart is. I know my insurance premium doesn’t directly pay for the Meemic Foundation grants, but I know that it helps to fund them. And I saved money in the process! Mary C. I felt Meemic took a personal interest in us. I loved that we had two touchpoints that we worked with the whole time, and we had direct contact to both of them. Meemic personified the personal touch that we needed at that time. We never were left on hold, transferred, and there was good communication between the two of them. The process was smooth! Jennifer F. On the few occasions when I’ve needed my Meemic insurance, the adjusters have treated me like family. Their first question was always to inquire about my safety. After learning I was fine, they quickly moved on to explain how my coverages and how I’d be taken care of. We all want an insurance company that cares for and takes care of us. In one word — that’s Meemic. Lolita C. Meemic has been a part of my life for many years since I first started teaching. Throughout these years, Meemic has become a part of my family. That is what makes this company different from others. They get to know you as an individual. If you are an educator, there is no better insurance than Meemic. They know our needs and serve with integrity. Michele P. I LOVE my Meemic insurance. I bought a house and I moved my car insurance and added my house all in one. They gave me the best price AND have been incredibly helpful and assisting with my first home purchase. Nina S. With my daughter turning 16 and starting to drive, I knew I needed to start shopping around for insurance, or at least see if I could save money by switching to another company. Over the years, I heard about Meemic Insurance Company, but I had never called for a quote. I discovered that Meemic had an office in Hortonville, which was great, because I really wanted to work with a local company. I couldn’t believe how much I was going to save, even though I had a new driver in the house. With a tight budget, this was truly a blessing. Susan B. Just bought a house and was in a time crunch, needed to get insurance for closing at last minute. Called that night and the agent was there early the next morning and took care of me very quickly! Excellent service and really appreciated. Needed insurance immediately for the closing. Don’t think other companies would have responded as quickly. Eric W. When our home was devastated by (a tornado) the Dexter Tornado, we were so glad we had Meemic. Our claims service was exceptional at a time when it really mattered. Jim V.

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/why-meemic/life-changers: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources The LifeChangers Take a look at the inspiring documentary “The LifeChangers: A Tale of Two Educators.” The short film follows a day in the life of Detroit Public Schools Community District teacher Michele Pizzo and Eastern Michigan University professor Lolita Cummings. Both teachers have had a profound impact on their students and institutions, and we’re pleased to share their stories. Watch the Film Meet the ‘LifeChanger’ Michele Pizzo Michele Pizzo is a 26-year teaching veteran and was a 2019-20 Michigan Regional Teacher of the Year. She has spent the majority of her career at Detroit’s Davison Elementary-Middle School. She taught fourth grade at Davison for 20 years and is currently a seventh-grade English Language Arts teacher. She has also served as a grade level chair, data specialist and collaborated with colleagues to write the school improvement plan. In addition, Michele is the district and school-wide spelling bee coordinator, preparing champions to compete in the Scripps National Spelling Bee. An ardent community advocate, Michele is passionate about bridging the school-home gap and its positive impact on student success. She is currently a lead coordinating teacher for the Detroit Public Schools Community District’s Parent Teacher Home Visit Program. The innovative program is part of a $3 million grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and aims to build a better connection with families. Pre-COVID, Michele volunteered her afternoons and weekends over the past several years to conduct regular home visits. She turned the experience into a leadership opportunity, training fellow teachers in a protocol for visiting their students’ homes. Meet the ‘LifeChanger’ Lolita Cummings Lolita Cummings is one of Eastern Michigan University’s more popular professors. After coming to EMU in 1994 as an assistant professor of public relations, Lolita poured her vast energy into the job, leading her to tenure and the title of associate professor in 1998. She was promoted to full professor in 2003. Since first arriving at EMU, Lolita has distinguished herself while speaking at academic and professional conferences, publishing in academic and professional journals and teaching for two different EMU colleges (Arts and Sciences and Business). And, yet, through it all, she has kept her sights on what’s most important to her – EMU’s students. After a series of racist incidents on campus, Lolita introduced random acts of kindness into her curriculum. Using the hashtags #campuskindness, #emusocialites and #eaglekindness on their social media platforms, her students have been able to help others and learn from one another through acts such as handing out gift cards, baking cupcakes and helping a new student who had broken his leg get around campus. Her students then write about the experience for class and continue to pay it forward. Meemic Insurance Company provides insurance for teachers and educators in Michigan.

At Meemic’s annual Souper Bowl, we held a bake sale that raised more than $430 for Big Brothers Big Sisters. Meemic sponsored several Georgia teachers to attend training at the Ron Clark Academy in Atlanta. Together, they made up RCA co-founder Kim Bearden’s Georgia All-Star team of exceptional educators. It was Ugly Sweater Day here at Meemic. We even had a contest, with the winner getting all the bragging rights. Meemic employees donated food baskets filled with nonperishable food items, toys, gift certificates and all the trimmings to create the perfect Thanksgiving dinner. The baskets went to 17 families from Walt Whitman Elementary in Pontiac, MI. A little (OK, a lot) of rain couldn’t dampen our spirits, and several Meemic employees dressed up in their Halloween best. It helps that we’re inside, though. All over the Meemic building, folks were in the spirit for #UnityDay2019. PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center (NBPC) promoted the day to “help create a world without bullying” by uniting for kindness, acceptance and inclusion. Meemic employees wore orange in honor of the day, brought in orange food and participated in a Unity Walk. Several people from Meemic (employees and their families) participated in the Making Strides Oakland County Michigan walk for breast cancer awareness and research on Oct. 19. Team Meemic blew past its goal of $500 to raise $752 for the event. The event raised about $109,000 from 1,500 participants. After last summer’s successful mural painting, Oakland Livingston Human Service Agency (OLHSA) asked us back to further brighten up the hallways for the kids who attend Head Start. And we were glad to do it. At Meemic, we don’t support educators solely through The Meemic Foundation. We are happy to step in with other assistance when we can. After a recent upgrade, the Meemic IT department was able to donate five servers to Lakeview Public Schools to help them with their own upgrade and allow them to spend their money in other ways to help students. We at Meemic are happy to offer our hearty congratulations to Cara Lougheed, Michigan's Teacher of the Year for 2019-20. Cara is an English and history teacher at Stoney Creek High School in Rochester Community Schools, MI. Here she is with Meemic Foundation director Pam Harlin, current Michigan Teacher of the Year - MTOY Laura Chang and presenting Meemic agent Michele Beitelshees. You can find out a bit more about her at Meemic.com/MTOY. It was mostly beautiful weather at Motor City Pride, and Meemic was, of course, proud to be there to help celebrate diversity and inclusion as one of the sponsors of the big event in downtown Detroit. Thanks to the Meemic employees and agents who helped out at the booth! Hooper and the Meemic volunteers greet eighth-graders who got to attend. Meemic and The Meemic Foundation were proud to work with Defeat the Label to support #Stand4Change Day and the #Rally4Change at Avondale High School. It looks like the Canada geese are on to us and now just want to chill out with the decoy dogs here at Meemic headquarters. They seem to be hanging out a lot more this year. We started judging in The Meemic Foundation’s latest Meemic Masterpieces art contest. It was the first step in finding 50 winners among more than 2,500 applications. And it sure isn’t an easy process – so many talented students out there! Tough decisions had to be made. Meemic and our friends at AAA pretty much took over Super Bowl Lanes in Canton, MI, for the 2019 Bowl for Kids’ Sake fundraiser, which raised money for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Metropolitan Detroit. Meemic bowlers contributed more than $11,000 toward a total of more than $80,000 for BBBS’ mentorship programs. Way to go, teams! You can bring your kids, you can bring your pets – why not bring your action figures? For many of us around the office, every day is Action Figure Work Day. Here are some of the figures hanging out at the office, just doing insurance stuff, including one especially impressive display. Let your geek flag fly! #AFWD2019 Meemic sends warm wishes as we celebrate Pat’s 30th anniversary with Meemic – and her retirement this month. Thirty years is a major milestone, and we’ll miss her. Meemic held its traditional Souper Bowl chili / soup cook-off, which raised $640 to support this year’s school volunteer events. Congrats to the winning teams: People’s Choice – Information Systems, Best Presentation – Marketing / eCommerce, Healthiest – Customer Service / Direct Sales and Spiciest – Underwriting / Product / Actuarial / Finance. All awards were well deserved. Compliments are free, yet priceless, gestures. A gray day can be turned into a positive one with a compliment. We set up a board for Copliment Day. Around the holidays, Meemic employees donated piles of toys for The Bottomless Toy Chest, an organization that delivers gifts year-round to hospitalized pediatric cancer patients. We’re so glad we can bring some smiles to kids stuck in a rotten situation. For Ugly Sweater Day, Meemic employees got to don their ugliest apparel, though most of the “ugly sweaters” were actually pretty cool. Meemic employees donated 23 food baskets filled with nonperishable food items, toys, gift certificates and all the trimmings to create the perfect Thanksgiving dinner. The baskets went to families from Walt Whitman Elementary in Pontiac, MI. Meemic Insurance donated two salvaged vehicles to automotive repair programs at two Ann Arbor Public Schools. Representatives from the Gordon Group Agency in Ann Arbor were on hand as a Hyundai Elantra went to Pioneer High School, and a Dodge Charger went to Huron High School. We hope everyone had a safe and fruitful (or candyful) night of trick-or-treating! The folks here at Meemic sure were ready. (Thanks to John Ploskonka Insurance Agency for the jack o' lantern photo. Thirty-two people from Meemic (employees and their families) participated in the Making Strides of Oakland County walk for breast cancer awareness and research on Oct. 27. Team Meemic raised $548 on a chilly, rainy morning. The “Big Game” came, and Meemic employees showed their team colors. Big-time local rivals Michigan Football and Michigan State Football got the bulk of the love, but there were some other colleges in there, too. Meemic would like to offer a hearty congratulations to Heather Duenas, the winner of this year’s Meemic Insurance Company Scholarship for Teacher Education at Oakland University in Rochester, MI. On Monday, May 14th, we invited our most loyal Meemic Members to celebrate them. These Members have been with Meemic for 60 or more uninterrupted years. Several Meemic volunteers visited the Oakland Livingston Human Services Agency, which hosts a Head Start program in Pontiac, MI, to paint three murals in the building and improve the landscaping outside. Several Meemic Masterpieces winners and their families, plus other art aficionados, came to Meemic headquarters to view the 50 winners and enjoy some local entertainment at our gallery open house. At Meemic, we know educators are superheroes. We got to prove it when we united The Educators, as team of super-powered school staff. Meet Mega Shift, Illumino, NeuroKnight, The Sanitizer and more at www.EducatorsUnite.org. The Meemic Foundation partnered with Defeat the Label and the Avondale School District to host the Rally4Change, to empower students and families as they rallied in support of anti-bullying, and creating a culture of kindness and diversity in their schools and communities. As with workplaces around the country, several Meemic employees brought their kids to the office for Take Your Kid to Work Day. There was also pizza, snacks and other activities. Here are a few of the rugrats. Congratulations to the winners of Souper Bowl 2018 Chili Cook-Off. Seven teams competed in several categories to raise money for the Baldwin Center, a charity in Pontiac, MI, that provides 25 programs to the local community. Together, the teams raised $630. A team from Meemic recently had the pleasure to help package soups for sale at Motown Soup in Utica, part of Trinity Lutheran Church. The charity sells a variety of soup mixes, baking mixes and more, and the proceeds help several local soup kitchens around Metro Detroit. Visit www.MotownSoup.com to order online or sign up to volunteer. You won’t be disappointed. This year, Meemic partnered with local nonprofit Bottomless Toy Chest for our holiday fundraiser. Based in West Bloomfield, MI, Bottomless Toy Chest delivers gifts to pediatric cancer patients spending their holidays in the hospital. It was founded by Mickey Guisewite, whose son was diagnosed with leukemia. Meemic would like to offer a hearty congratulations to Amber Miller, the winner of this year’s Meemic Insurance Company Scholarship for Teacher Education at Oakland University in Rochester, MI. Sure, it’s all smiles in this photo, but the Dalmatians in two Meemic departments had to be wary of Cruella De Vil and her henchmen this Halloween. No coats for us! Meemic has partnered with Avondale High School in Avondale School District, to form the Meemic-Avondale Insurance Institute. Students will get regular hands-on experience with members of the insurance industry. More than just job shadowing, the initiative offers opportunities like this one, where students visited a fire loss site. Several people from Meemic (employees and their families) participated in the Making Strides Oakland County Michigan walk for breast cancer awareness and research on Oct. 7. Team Meemic raised $500 toward more than $50,000 total for the event. Avast, ye scurvy knaves! The staff at Meemic be ready to hunt for buried treasure on Talk Like a Pirate Day. At this Meemic Foundation Workshop featuring Jerzy Drozd, teachers learned exercises they can use with their students to teach literacy fundamentals through creating comics in a wide variety of subjects, from English and social studies to music and world languages. Four members of the Meemic Riders (Chris, Tammy, Holly and Lisa) took part (along with our friends at AAA, the ACG Riderz) in the fifth annual Ride 4 Recovery. The event celebrates recovery, supports the individuals and families suffering and recovering from addiction, and raises awareness of the behavioral health and substance use disorders that affect our communities. Meemic had some special guests! Kids were our invited guests to help us learn about what animation styles are preferred at their age. (This one might not have been the most popular.) This will help Meemic with ideas we’re developing to support teachers in the classroom. Forty-eight bowlers, family members and friends converged on Classic Lanes in Rochester Hills, MI, to raise money for The Meemic Foundation’s Needy Schools Project to purchase supplies for a Michigan school in need. Thank you to all the participants and to Classic Lanes for hosting. A similar fundraiser was held in Illinois. Congratulations to the new employees joining the Meemic Family!! We are excited to have them become part of our team. If you’re interested in joining Meemic, we’re hiring. Visit www.Meemic.com/Careers Go, Team Oddballs! We went out to support our amazing coworkers at the Auburn Hills Civic Center. Thanks for the great game, everyone! It was a Christmas trifecta on Ugly Sweater Day: tree, presents and elf! Our agents often like to drop in at schools with donuts or cakes or other care packages, but Teacher Appreciation Week really gets them wearing out their shoe leather. For example, the Williams Insurance Agency in Monroe, MI, created care packages filled with lots of goodies. Meemic volunteers were on hand as dozens of students, mostly from junior high and high school, learned about various careers at Utica Community Schools’ annual Career Expo. The volunteers discussed the diversity of careers available in the insurance industry, including agent, human resources, claims, software development, marketing, customer service, project management and more. Meemic employees visit several career fairs throughout the year. Marketing and social media intern Alex shares his experience at www.Meemic.com/Blog. Meemic celebrated Take Your Action Figure to Work Day with heroes who are also teachers. The children and grandchildren of Meemc employees were bright eyed and bushy tailed for their first day of school. Several agents teamed up to provide hundreds of bottles of water to Flint. Meemic was founded by a group of teachers in 1950. This bunch soon became our core team (from left): Norman Bradow, Aaron Carmean, Richard Cramer, Earl Hollinger, Emil Kunze, Richard Ramsdell and Charles Saltzer. For more on our history, visit www.Meemic.com Our first Fore! Education golf fundraiser brought in more than $11,000 for The Meemic Foundation to give directly to schools. Representatives from Meemic’s legal department visited University Preparatory Academy’s third-fifth-grade classes to discuss job opportunities involving the law. The panel, which included a judge, also conducted a candy negotiation exercise. The goal is to introduce students to people working in the legal field and teach them a useful skill attorneys and other legal professionals utilize on a regular basis. The program is sponsored by the Detroit Metropolitan Bar Association’s School Partnership Program. We’re hiring! Visit www.Meemic.com/Careers Meemic volunteers teamed up to convert an unused room into a comforting teachers lounge for the staff at Paul Robeson/Malcom X Academy in Detroit.

Meemic proudly recognizes Luke Wilcox as the 2017-18 Michigan Teacher of the Year. Luke is a math teacher at East Kentwood High School. The MTOY award is a prestigious honor that focuses public attention on excellence in teaching. Meemic Insurance Company has been a proud sponsor of the Michigan Department of Education Teacher of the Year program since 2007 and looks forward to working with Luke! When Washington Elementary School in Mundelein, IL, needed books, Lynn Epperson of Lynn Epperson Insurance in Lake Villa answered the call. She donated $200 worth of books to the school library and enlisted some super help. A group of royalty and superheroes delivered the books and read to the kids. Whatever you want to call it (Bring Your Child to Work Day, Take Your Kid to Work Day), the halls at Meemic were full of bright young faces learning about everything their parents do, from customer service to claims to sales to maintaining our website. They took some time out as a group to write thank you notes to teachers and play games. Whether you work at a school or know somebody who does, you probably know a teacher, principal, custodian, cafeteria worker or beyond who deserves a big thank you. We’ve got just the thing: a Leaves of Love certificate. Visit www.Meemic.com/LeavesOfLove, download the certificate, present it, snap a photo and post it to your favorite platform with the hashtag #LeavesOfLove.

We asked a group of kids what they love about their teachers. We released one video, but we got so many great responses, we couldn’t stop there. She’s Always Bouncing Around … What? Take a quick peek into the minds of your children and students as we gather a group to talk about what they love abouttheir teachers. You’ll be surprised by some of the answers. One hundred million thousand one hundred . . . what?? Though teachers deserve rock star salaries, that’s not the case in the real world. But it’s a really good thing these kids aren’t in charge of the paychecks! At least their hearts are in the right place. You’re really just playing a baseball game . . . what?? Who makes more — a teacher or a baseball player? If it were up to this group, it would be the teachers. Smart kids. Nobody would be smart . . . what?? What the world would be like without teachers? Crazy! Two fish . . . what?? Chocolate, candy, books — they’re all pretty popular. But watch out, teachers, you might wind up with fish or a lizard. The teachers can teach the kids, but the president makes the laws . . . what?? Whose job is more important — the president or the teacher? With this group, it could go either way. What School Children Love About Their Teachers In our original video, we asked kids to describe why they love their teachers; you’ll be amazed at their answers! They extol the virtues of their teachers, from the classroom to the playground. Meemic Insurance Company provides insurance for teachers and educators in Michigan.

Don’t Forget Maintenance If you own an RV and haven’t found the time to get it on the road much during the last few years, it’s important that you continue maintaining the vehicle. Ideally, you should be parking it in a covered area, but that’s not always possible depending on the space you have available. You’ll need to take special care if you are storing your RV in an uncovered area, where it is exposed to the elements 24/7. New Michigan Distracted Driving Law in Effect Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has signed into law a bill making it illegal to hold and use a mobile electronic device while operating a motor vehicle in Michigan. With the bill signing, Michigan becomes the 26th state in the U.S. to establish hands-free driving laws. Do Roundabouts Make You Nervous? Follow These Tips More cities and towns throughout the United States are replacing four-way intersections with roundabouts to help with traffic flow and reduce the chances of accidents. While navigating a roundabout can be daunting and confusing for many people, it’s in your best interest (and that of others on the road) that you learn how to safely drive in one. Reducing Your Risk When Driving at Night Driving at night is more dangerous, even though there is often less traffic than during daylight hours. In fact, nighttime crashes are three times more fatal than those that occur during the day, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Have You Checked If Your Car Is Subject to Recall? Over the past five years, 150 million vehicles have been recalled by manufacturers in the U.S. It’s great that regulators and auto makers are constantly looking for issues that can cause danger to drivers and passengers, and recalls have likely saved thousands of lives. The problem is that not all drivers are taking the recalls seriously. 4 Towing Scams and How to Avoid Them – and Fight Back For many Americans, a vehicle is like a second home. When it is involved in an accident or breaks down, the next step towards getting it back on the road is to call a towing company. Although the majority of towing companies are reputable and honest, some may try to scam consumers. From inflated rates to fictitious fees, there are several ways that dishonest companies take advantage of unassuming consumers. The High Cost of a Drunk Driving Arrest More than 10,000 people die every year in car accidents that involve at least one driver who is under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. And while the number of accidents involving alcohol is in the tens of thousands, about 1.5 million people are arrested annually for driving under the influence, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Common Insurance Myths - Busted Two of the most common myths about insurance are that red cars cost more to insure and that houses should be insured for their real market value. However, red cars do not always cost more to insure, and houses should generally be insured based on how much it would cost to rebuild them. Because rebuilding costs can vary greatly from one area of the country to another, some homes may be significantly under-insured or even over-insured. Do You Need Comprehensive Car Insurance Coverage? In auto insurance, there are two main types of physical damage losses to your car: losses caused by collision and losses not caused by collision. The auto insurance coverages for these two types of losses are often referred to as collision coverage and comprehensive coverage. Cruising Green: 5 Tips for More Eco-Friendly Driving With climate change concerns growing, some people have started taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint while behind the wheel. While you can go all in and buy an electric vehicle, there are actually things you can do with a gas-powered car that will use less fuel and reduce its emissions. With a little know-how and the right tech, you can play a part in helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 7 Steps for Preparing Your Vehicle for Long-Term Storage Storing a vehicle for an extended period — whether because you’re traveling abroad or safeguarding a classic or antique car — requires thoughtful preparation.

Read the Owner’s Manual You’ll want to service and maintain your RV as recommended in the owner’s manual.Consider these specific tips for looking after each key part of your vehicle: The Roof The roof of your RV is exposed to all the elements if parked outdoors, including harsh summer sun and excessive heat, wind, rain, snow and hail. You should make a habit of regularly inspecting the roof for damage, like cracks, flaking and peeling.To avoid extensive damage, be careful of where you park, particularly if it’s under a tree that drops fruits, berries, seeds, sap or other stuff that will sit and fester on the roof if left unattended.If your RV comes equipped with a factory-installed ladder, you’ll be able to walk on the roof. If it doesn’t, use a ladder to work on your roof from the side.When washing the roof, simply use a car cleaning solution mixed with water.Every six months, inspect the roof seals and seams to ensure they are intact and not leaking. If you spot any issues, have them repaired immediately to prevent further damage.Repairing water damage can be extremely costly. Considering applying sealant to the seals and seams to prevent future leaks from occurring.If your RV has a rubber roof, you should treat it annually to prevent sun damage. Awnings When storing your RV make sure to retract the awning to avoid damage, particularly from winds or mold and mildew.Clean the awning with a proper awning cleaner at least once a year. These can be found at most RV supply stores and should be sprayed onto the awning before scrubbing or rinsing.Also, inspect your awning annually if you rarely use your RV, including: Slide-outs Once or twice a year, check your slide-out to make sure that nothing is sticking when you retract or open it. Clear out any debris you find and apply slide-out lubricant to ensure easy functioning. Rodents Proper maintenance helps prevent rodent damage, but it’s always a good idea to keep an eye out.

However, red cars do not always cost more to insure, and houses should generally be insured based on how much it would cost to rebuild them. Because rebuilding costs can vary greatly from one area of the country to another, some homes may be significantly under-insured or even over-insured.Researchers recently conducted a survey with 2,000 participants to test policyholders’ knowledge about common insurance myths. To do this, they read each participant several false statements about insurance. Their research showed that men were more likely to believe insurance myths. However, one exception was that women were more likely to believe the myth that red cars are more expensive to insure.One of the biggest disparities between men and women in believing a myth was the myth that speeding tickets do not follow a person home if they are received out of state. More than 65 percent of men believed this myth was true, while less than 35 percent of women believed it.The following are additional insurance myths, truths, and statistics gathered by the researchers:Myth: Insurance coverage should be purchased for a home based on its real market value.As mentioned above, the cost to rebuild the home is the amount for which a home should generally be insured. This amount should include the cost of both materials and labor. Of those surveyed, 55 percent of men and 45 percent of women believed this myth.Myth: It is always cheaper to insure a small car.Both mid-size and small minivans or SUVs are usually cheaper to insure. However, the cost of insurance depends on several factors, and not just the size of the car. Because inexperienced drivers often select small cars, they are not always the cheapest to insure due to the higher risks associated with an individual’s lack of driving experience. About 40 percent of women believed this, and nearly 60 percent of men believed it.Myth: Comprehensive auto coverage includes everything.There are generally limitations with this type of coverage, which are explained in each insurance policy. Based on the policy language, comprehensive auto coverage may only cover certain losses associated with theft, animal collisions, vandalism and storm damage, for example. About 30 percent of women and 60 percent of men believed this myth.Myth: Thieves prefer stealing new vehicles.Thieves are more likely to steal older cars to sell for parts. About 40 percent of women and 60 percent of men believed this myth.Myth: If a policyholder loans his or her car to a friend who crashes it, the friend’s insurance company will cover the damage.When someone else crashes a policyholder’s car, the policyholder and his or her insurer may be required to pay for the damage to the car, depending on the policy language and the facts and circumstances of the accident. Slightly less than 50 percent of women and slightly more than 50 percent of men believed this myth.Experts say that all of these misconceptions can lead to financial losses. It is important to always ask questions. To learn more, discuss your concerns with an insurance agent.  This blog post provides general information only. Insurance coverage is subject to all policy terms, conditions, exclusions and limitations. Insurance coverage is determined on a claim-by-claim basis based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, the applicable policy language, and applicable statutory provisions.

Follow These Tips More cities and towns throughout the United States are replacing four-way intersections with roundabouts to help with traffic flow and reduce the chances of accidents. While navigating a roundabout can be daunting and confusing for many people, it’s in your best interest (and that of others on the road) that you learn how to safely drive in one. Even if your city doesn’t have roundabouts, you may find them in other towns or cities that you visit, so you should learn the rules in advance.Roundabouts have been proven to be safer than regular four-way intersections since all vehicles are going in the same direction and they eliminate left turns against oncoming traffic — a major cause of accidents. Also, roundabouts force motorists to drive more slowly by their design. Roundabout Guidance Approach:When approaching a roundabout there will usually be a sign warning you about it, and there will also usually be a yield sign right before it. If you’re approaching a multi-lane roundabout there will likely be two signs: If it is a two-lane roundabout, and you plan to make a right turn at the next street intersecting the roundabout, you should approach in the right-hand lane. If you plan to exit at another street intersecting the roundabout, opt for the left lane.Before entering any roundabout, slow down and prepare to yield to any vehicles that are already in the roundabout. If there is a crosswalk, look out for pedestrians.Entering the roundabout:Yield to any vehicles in the roundabout and enter only when it’s clear. The action is akin to when entering a freeway or turning right at a red traffic light.Navigating the roundabout:Once you enter, accelerate to the speed limit or the flow of traffic. If there are two lanes, you should stay in the inside lane to keep turning left. The golden rule of roundabouts is to yield to other drivers and stay in your lane. If you change lanes in a two-lane traffic circle, you could cause an accident or backup.Also, you should never stop when you are in the roundabout. Instead, go with the flow of traffic.Exiting the roundabout:When it’s time to exit the roundabout, you should signal your intention to do so by using your right-turn signal. Be sure to look for any pedestrians or bicycles that may be crossing before you proceed. If you are in the inside lane, you’ll need to plan ahead, signal right, change lanes and turn left onto your street.Finally, you should exit the roundabout slowly and safely, making sure to merge into the appropriate lane. Other tips You should always drive defensively and allow plenty of space between your car and the vehicles ahead. If another driver becomes confused and stops their vehicle in the roundabout, be patient and wait for them to proceed.If a vehicle operator were to attempt to go around a confused driver, added chaos could result, possibly causing vehicle conflicts. So, it’s in everyone’s best interest to wait for these vehicles, and then continue through the roundabout.Also, if an emergency vehicle enters the roundabout, if the roadway in the roundabout is wide enough, you should pull as far to the right as possible and allow it to pass. However, it is generally better to completely clear the intersection and pull off to the side of the road after exiting the roundabout.

When it is involved in an accident or breaks down, the next step towards getting it back on the road is to call a towing company. Although the majority of towing companies are reputable and honest, some may try to scam consumers. From inflated rates to fictitious fees, there are several ways that dishonest companies take advantage of unassuming consumers.Steering:With this type of scam, a towing firm shows up quickly after an accident without being contacted. They find out about crashes through police scans. The at-fault driver may be in on the scam as well, and he or she will try to convince the victim to have the vehicle taken to a body shop that the towing company recommends. Steering is an illegal activity in most states.Fee Inflation:Some towing companies may inflate their fees beyond a person’s auto policy limit or beyond a warranty reimbursement limit. This forces the individual to pay out of pocket. Always call a few towing firms to compare rates before choosing one. Be suspicious of firms that ask for information about policy limits.Patrol Towing:With this scam, a towing company has one or more spotters who look for parking violators. The spotters notify the company, and the company quickly tows the offending vehicle to an impound lot. The impound company and the towing company may both try to charge inflated rates.Gate Fees and Labor Fees:Labor fees and gate fees are both scams. These charges are implemented to release a vehicle to an owner. Another possible fraudulent fee is a release fee. It is illegal in most states to charge a gate fee, a labor fee or a release fee. How to Fight Back There are several ways to avoid becoming a victim of an unscrupulous towing company. These are some helpful tips for staying safe: It is important for consumers to know their rights. There are state laws in place to protect people if a vehicle is towed while the owner is away. Operators must leave a sign at the scene with the towing company’s name, phone number, address, who requested the tow and the reason for towing. Also, towing firms must take a photo of a car that is parked illegally. Ask for proof of this from a towing company if a vehicle was towed while shopping or while conducting a similar errand. In most states, the towing operator must release the vehicle even if the person cannot or will not pay the fee. However, the operator may take the case to civil court if he or she has a legitimate claim.  This article is meant to be informational only. It is not legal advice and should not be interpreted as such. To learn more about rights and towing scams, discuss concerns with an agent. Related Articles Do Roundabouts Make You Nervous?

Over the past five years, 150 million vehicles have been recalled by manufacturers in the U.S.It’s great that regulators and auto makers are constantly looking for issues that can cause danger to drivers and passengers, and recalls have likely saved thousands of lives. The problem is that not all drivers are taking the recalls seriously.In fact, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that about 25% of car owners do not respond to a recall. For the safety of yourself, your family, your passengers and the general public, you should always participate fully in recalls, which are always free safety fixes.It’s also important to understand from the manufacturer whether or not your vehicle is safe to drive until the repair is completed. In some cases, the risk of injury will be far too great, and you will need to bring the car in immediately.For example, if you’ve bought a car in the last two decades, there is a good chance that it came installed with airbags that have been part of a massive recall involving brands worldwide. You may have received a letter from the carmaker informing you that you need to go in and have the airbags swapped out.And while roughly 67 million of the airbags have been recalled, about 17 million have not been replaced. Don't Ignore the Letter The worst thing you can do is ignore this letter, as it will cost you nothing to fix the airbags except time.And if you haven’t received a letter and have a vehicle that was made since 2001, you should check to see if your car is on the recall list. If you don’t, you could be putting your life and the lives of your family in danger if you have an accident.If you have a used car, you would be unlikely to ever receive notifications of recalls. But you can also check for any recalls that apply to your vehicle onthis website. The Takeaway Regardless of if your car seems to be running fine or the repair seems minor, ignoring a recall could put you and your passengers in harm’s way. Take all recalls seriously.

You’d not only be looking at fines, but also legal fees, impound fees and many years of higher insurance premiums, among other costs.In every state, it’s illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or higher. That may not sound like much, but if you have a BAC of even just 0.1 percent, you would likely be quite impaired.To be over the limit may involve having just one drink for a small adult or two drinks for someone who weighs 200 pounds or more. How the Costs Mount Up Besides the fact that you can change someone else’s life forever if you drive under the influence, here’s what you can expect in terms of extra costs: As you can see, the numbers add up quickly and you could be looking at extra outlays of at least $10,000 – and close to $20,000 if your case is more serious. Also, the above costs do not take into consideration if you injure or kill a third party.In addition, Meemic may drop you when it’s time to renew, forcing you to shop around for new coverage, which is not easy with a fresh DUI arrest on your record. You may have to use an insurer that specializes in high-risk drivers, and that will cost you, too.A DUI will stay on your Department of Motor Vehicles driving record at least five years in most states, and as long as 10 years in others. The Takeaway The best way to avoid all of these costs is not to drink and drive, period. But, if you are ever arrested for a DUI offense, you should contact your agent to discuss your insurance options.

In fact, nighttime crashes are three times more fatal than those that occur during the day, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).There are a few reasons for these sad statistics: But sometimes we have no choice but to drive at night. So if you are heading out, you may want to consider these tips from NHTSA to reduce your chances of being in an accident.Don’t drive while drowsy:You should not drive when you are sleepy. If you are on your way home from out of town or working a late shift and you are feeling drowsy, it’s best to pull over and get some caffeine in your system and rest a while.People have a number of techniques to wake themselves up, including turning the radio on and singing, rolling down the windows for fresh air or stopping and taking a short walk to get the blood flowing again.But if you are really tired, you should probably find a place to stay for the night. It’s not worth becoming a statistic for want of a good sleep.Drive defensively:One of the big dangers at night is other drowsy drivers or motorists driving under the influence. People in these states are more likely to not stop at red lights, to speed and to drive erratically. It’s on you to watch out for them. Put your defenses up and be on high alert for bad drivers.Avoid two-lane highways:Head-on collisions happen most frequently on two-lane highways or roads. There are no barriers, no median and when you pass oncoming traffic you are both going fast and not too far apart from each other. Try to give the opposing lane a wide berth by driving more to the right edge of your lane.These roads are also dangerous because of the likelihood of being blinded briefly by oncoming vehicles’ headlights. Two-lane highways often have many turns, which makes them even more dangerous. If you can, use a safer route at night.Reduce your speed:Speeding is involved in 37 percent of vehicle crash fatalities at night, compared to 21 percent during the day, according to the NTHSA. Adjust your speed at night, so you have more time to react to dangers.Use high-beams in right conditions:You should use your high-beams at night whenever possible if there is no oncoming traffic. This is especially the case in rural areas. Just remember to turn them to low-beams when you are within 500 feet of an oncoming car or driving behind another vehicle.Turn down interior lighting:If your dashboard lights are too bright, it can reduce your ability to see the road ahead, especially if you look down towards your speedometer and then back to the dark road ahead, requiring your eyes to adjust to the darkness again. Dim your interior lights for nighttime driving enough that you can still see the important gauges.Look away from car lights:To avoid being blinded by the lights of an oncoming vehicle, you should shift your eyes down and to the right and use the right edge of the road or lane markings to keep you on track. Once the car has passed, look at the full road ahead again.  This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

In auto insurance, there are two main types of physical damage losses to your car: losses caused by collision and losses not caused by collision. The auto insurance coverages for these two types of losses are often referred to as collision coverage and comprehensive coverage. What Is Comprehensive Coverage? Comprehensive car insurance is auto insurance that provides coverage for loss to a vehicle caused by an object, disaster, animal impact or theft. It also provides coverage for loss to a vehicle caused by fire, falling objects, explosions or other unexpected, non-collision-related disasters. Comprehensive insurance does not cover bodily injury. Collision car insurance is auto insurance that provides coverage for loss to a vehicle caused by an auto accident. Collision coverage reimburses the insured for the cost of repairs or replacement of a vehicle after an auto accident. You can usually purchase collision coverage without comprehensive coverage, but you will usually need to purchase collision coverage in order to add comprehensive coverage to an auto insurance policy. Contact us to learn more about the comprehensive coverage and collision coverage options Meemic offers.* Loans and Leases Usually Require Comprehensive Coverage If you lease your vehicle or took out a loan to buy it, the dealership or bank probably required you to purchase comprehensive coverage. They may have also mandated a certain comprehensive coverage deductible amount. Be sure you understand these requirements when you talk to your insurance agent about coverage for your new vehicle. Do You Need It? Comprehensive car insurance may be most useful for owners of vehicles that are less than 5 years old. The premium for comprehensive coverage and collision coverage can account for 30% to 40% of your total premium. However, if you do not purchase either of these coverages, you will likely have to pay to repair or replace your vehicle in the event of an accident that is your fault, or if your vehicle gets totaled or stolen. Factor in the Deductible If you decide to carry collision and comprehensive coverage (whether your car is 5 or 15 years old), you should carefully consider your deductibles based on what you can afford. Deductibles directly affect your premium. This information is provided for general informational purposes only.

With a little know-how and the right tech, you can play a part in helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Lighten Your Load First things first: Let’s talk about decluttering your ride. Lightening your vehicle’s load can improve its fuel efficiency.So, if you are hauling around stuff that you don’t need all the time, you should unload your car before hitting the road. The lighter your car, the less fuel it guzzles. As well, if you always drive around with a roof rack, it, too, adds to the car’s weight. Keep in mind that the roof rack also reduces aerodynamics, worsening your gas mileage even further. Remove the roof rack when not using it. No Pedal to the Metal If you have a need for speed, try practicing some restraint. Driving fast and furious might be exhilarating, but you’ll burn through fuel fast.Instead, embrace a smoother driving style. Gradual acceleration and gentle braking not only save gas, but also make for a safer and more relaxed ride. Your passengers — and your wallet — will thank you. Cruise Control to the Rescue If you’ve got a highway ahead of you, why not let your cruise control take over, when it’s safe to do so? By maintaining a steady speed, cruise control helps optimize fuel efficiency, giving you more miles per gallon. Keep Tires Properly Inflated Underinflated tires increase rolling resistance, which means your engine has to work harder to keep those wheels turning. Not only is this a drain on fuel efficiency, but it’s also a safety hazard.So, grab that tire gauge and make sure your tires are inflated to the manufacturer’s recommended pressure. Consider Going Electric Last but certainly not least, let’s talk about electric vehicles, which have zero tailpipe emissions and lower operating costs than gas-powered vehicles.There’s an electric ride for every taste and budget for those that want to erase their vehicle’s carbon footprint.While the prices of EVs are still higher than for other cars, they are coming down and there are new, less expensive ones expected to hit the U.S. market in the next few years.

A few key steps can ensure your car remains in good condition during storage, minimizing the risk of damage and making it easier to bring back on the road when the time comes. Here’s a detailed guide on how to properly prepare and store your vehicle, along with insights into insurance considerations for “garaging” it. 1. Clean the Vehicle Before storing your vehicle, clean both the exterior and interior thoroughly. Dirt, road salt, bird droppings and other debris can damage the paint or metal if left on for an extended period. Here’s what to do: 2. Top Off Fluids Ensuring your vehicle’s fluids are at the proper levels helps prevent corrosion and keeps the components lubricated while in storage. Here’s what needs to be done: 3. Top Up Tires Proper tire care is crucial for long-term vehicle storage to avoid flat spots and uneven wear. You should: 4. Battery Maintenance A vehicle’s battery will slowly drain if left unused. To prevent this: 5. Protect Against Pests Rodents and other pests can cause damage to a stored vehicle by chewing wires, nesting in the engine bay or damaging upholstery. It’s wise to: 6. Cover the Vehicle Using a quality car cover can protect your vehicle from dust, moisture and debris during long-term storage. For indoor storage use a breathable, indoor car cover that allows moisture to escape but keeps dust off. If storing it outside, use a weatherproof cover to shield it from the elements. 7. Check Your Coverage for ‘Garaging’ Ensuring proper insurance coverage while your car is in storage can save you from potential issues. Whatever you do, don’t cancel your coverage. Instead, consider: A Final Word Properly preparing your vehicle for long-term storage involves attention to detail and a little effort upfront, but it can save you from costly repairs or degradation over time. From cleaning and fluid checks to tire care and battery maintenance, these steps help ensure your car is ready to go when you return.

Our ideas for insurance-related resolutions can help you save money and ensure that all of your important assets are properly insured. You may want to think about the following three resolutions: Investigate Premium Discounts Insurance companies price their policies based on the amount of risk they are taking to insure you. But there are steps you can take to help reduce your risks, and as a result lower your premiums. While you are already likely taking advantage of various premium discounts, you may not know about others that insurers offer. You can call us to find out if you qualify for any of the following: Another way to reduce your auto premiums is to raise the deductible on your vehicle collision and comprehensive coverage. Make a Home Inventory The reason we purchase insurance is to help us recover, rebuild and replace after a loss. Recent years have seen high tornado and wind activity, and flooding, all resulting in thousands of Michiganders losing their possessions and homes. Keeping a comprehensive home inventory (and updating it annually) can help you replace your belongings after a loss, as accurate records will make it less likely that there will be a dispute between you and your insurer if you ever file a claim. Identify and Fix Coverage Gaps One scenario you do not want to experience is filing a claim only to find out that your loss isn’t covered under any of your policies. We can work with you to try and eliminate those scenarios, but there are also times when your circumstances change. If you don’t update your insurance coverage accordingly, you might find yourself with a gap in coverage. Pay extra attention to big-ticket items like jewelry, which may not be fully covered under your homeowner’s policy. If this is the case, you may want to consider increasing coverage or scheduling these items. Coverage can be increased on jewelry, watches, furs, silverware, goldware, platinumware and pewterware. Scheduled personal property coverage is for sudden and accidental direct physical loss or damage to the insured items, and a deductible typically does not apply. Similarly, you can look into flood insurance if you are not already covered. Flooding is not covered by a typical homeowners policy and even if your mortgage provider does not require it, it doesn’t mean you don’t need it. Meemic doesn’t offer flood insurance directly, but we can help you find an insurer that does. Contact us so we can help you find potential gaps in your coverage and discounts that may put a little more money in your pocket this year.

Although you are always required to meet the minimums, you may consider scaling back on your optional insurance coverages to save money as your car ages. But when is the right time? Preferably when the math works out in your favor, so that you trade off the money you save on your premium for more risk but at a lower cost than when your car was new. The following is a rough guide on car insurance coverage that you can use to help determine what is appropriate for you and your vehicle. Fresh Off the Lot If you are financing your car, the lender will require that you carry collision and comprehensive coverage. But even if you paid cash for that new car, it behooves you to carry the same coverage. Comprehensive coverage generally covers anything that might happen to your car, like hail damage, if someone hits your vehicle in a parking lot and runs, or if it is vandalized. In this case, the insurance generally covers the value of the damage (minus your deductible). Collision coverage generally covers the cost of repairing or replacing your vehicle if it's damaged in an accident, regardless of who is at fault. This includes both collisions with other vehicles and collisions with stationary objects. If you really want to be covered all the way for that new car, you can also buy gap insurance. Gap coverage makes up the difference between what your insurance policy may deem the value of your car to be if it is totaled, and what you still owe the lender. Close to Paying Off Your Loan (Car 2-5 Years Old) If you are close to paying off your loan, you may want to consider dropping gap coverage as the car is likely worth more than what you owe. Once you pay off the loan, if it's still between 2 and 5 years old, you may want to keep comprehensive and collision coverage, as you would still be out of pocket considerably if it is totaled or stolen and not recovered. 6 to 11 Years Old At this point, you may want to consider getting rid of your comprehensive coverage. But before you do that, you should determine what your car is worth in the resale market, using the Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds.com. Whatever is in the Kelley Blue Book is what your insurer would pay you if the car is totaled. Would you be OK losing that much if your car is totaled or stolen, or if it suffers significant damage that was your fault? Compare how much you save every month with that figure and determine for yourself if dropping comprehensive and collision coverage is worth it. 12 Years and Older If you're still paying full coverage at this point, the value of your vehicle may no longer be worth the burden of the higher premium. One option is to ditch collision coverage, which tends to be more expensive, but keep comprehensive, which will still cover your vehicle in case of that parking lot hit-and-run and theft. If you are still unsure, you can call us and we can help you determine what coverage may best for you. This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

Your state’s goal is to make the required insurance affordable, but in many cases, the established minimum coverage is not adequate to cover the liability costs if you are found to be at fault in a costly accident. Even limits that are several tiers above the minimum may not be adequate for some drivers, because once those limits are exhausted, any remaining damages must be paid out of pocket. This is important to consider as the cost of automobile claims has been rising rapidly during the past 10 years for a few reasons: Bankruptcy is the first thought that comes to mind for people trying to avoid paying excess damages, but bankruptcy does not come without problems. It will probably hurt or even eliminate your chances of getting credit in the future; even if credit can be obtained, it will cost you a lot more and come with conditions. Because the costs and lost opportunities that result from bankruptcy are significant, it’s not an option most people want to or should choose. For that reason, let’s instead look at your obligations and how to minimize your risk of having to pay for damages that could be covered by higher liability limits. Consider the following example: You have an auto policy with a liability limit of $100,000. One afternoon, your car’s brakes fail and you rear-end the car in front of you with very high impact, paralyzing the driver. Once Meemic has paid your limit, it becomes your obligation to pay for any further damages. In the example above, if the injured party is justified in asking for $3 million, Meemic would pay the $100,000 for which you are covered, and you would then be expected to pay the remaining $2.9 million. Alternatively, the injured party could take you to court, which could easily cost you hundreds of thousands in legal fees in addition to any judgment granted to the plaintiff. Even if you file bankruptcy at that point, if you have assets, you would have to pay what you have and possibly lose everything. Your wages also may be garnished to pay any judgment. In any case, not having adequate liability, let alone minimum limits set by the state, is not really a solution. What You Can Do The smart choice is to opt for an auto policy with higher limits. Premiums in most cases are not significantly more for higher liability limits. Another option is an umbrella policy, which is available in increments of a million dollars that would cover liability for all the vehicles in your household for one low premium. With such options available, why risk damaging your future with a bankruptcy or, worse yet, losing everything you own because you did not plan in advance to set up coverages that would protect you? It doesn’t cost you anything to discuss the options with us. We can walk you through the various options for increasing your auto policy’s liability or secure an umbrella policy that would cover your entire household – as well as other non-auto related liability claims, such as someone injuring themselves at your home. Close to Paying Off Your Loan (Car 2-5 Years Old) If you are close to paying off your loan, you may want to consider dropping gap coverage as the car is likely worth more than what you owe. Once you pay off the loan, if it's still between 2 and 5 years old, you may want to keep comprehensive and collision coverage, as you would still be out of pocket considerably if it is totaled or stolen and not recovered. All insurance claim submissions are subject to verification of coverage. Only your policy indicates the coverage afforded to you in the case of a loss.

In the Midwest, that means unpredictable cold weather and snow ahead. While the weather is still nice, it’s time for homeowners to start securing their homes for protection against wind, snow, ice and other harsh elements. The most common causes of damage to homes during the colder months are hail, rain and wind. Renter’s Insurance Is a Great Value A recent study found that millennials, especially, are renting in larger numbers than ever before, but that they are not getting renter’s coverage even though it’s inexpensive and can provide protection for their belongings. Researchers also found that most (75%) of the people surveyed did not know they could obtain renter’s insurance for about the same monthly cost as a pair of movie tickets, and had therefore not purchased coverage for their possessions. What You Need to Know: Home Sharing Airbnb and other home-share programs have become popular among frequent travelers and homeowners. The ability to rent a cozy room or home in your favorite city, or the opportunity to make a little money for an area of your home you are not currently using, seems like a win-win. Protecting Valuables Home Safe Vs Safe Deposit Box While most of us take steps to protect our assets from fire and theft, there are some items in your home that you likely cannot afford to lose in any circumstances. Think: birth certificates, passports, Social Security cards, tax documents and any collections of valuable items, such as stamps or coins. Often we default to using either a home safe or storing the most important of these items in a safe-deposit box in a bank. Safeguard Your Wedding Ring with the Right Insurance Wearing a wedding ring is a tradition that dates back centuries. According to The Knot.com, the custom began with the Romans, who believed that “the vein of love\" in the fourth finger of the left hand traveled directly to the heart. Will Your Insurance Cover You While Moving? Every year, millions of people move – from one apartment to another, from an apartment to a home, or from one home to another. Moving is a stressful process, filled with dozens of logistical details and concerns. One set of concerns that many people never consider is whether and how their insurance will apply to their property and any motor vehicles they use during the move. Battening Down the Hatches on Your Cottage for the Winter As we hit the tail end of summer and fall beckons, many Up North cottage owners opt to batten down the hatches for the winter months and don’t plan on returning until the spring. During that time, particularly if the winter is harsh, a lot can go wrong. Pipes can burst, snow can drift in if you have any holes that need repairing, and pests can enter the cottage. If you plan to button up your vacation home for the winter, you will want to take steps to protect it from these and other risks. In a Homeowners Association?

Often we default to using either a home safe or storing the most important of these items in a safe-deposit box in a bank.If you don’t have a plan for which documents and other important items you need to keep out of harm’s way, we can help you sort through the confusion here.First off, if you don’t have a home safe, or a safe-deposit box at your bank, you need to consider which one is best for you and decide what to keep inside. In most cases, though, if you want the best in protection, you should have both.Here’s what you need to know: Home Safes If you are selecting a home safe, you’ll want one that can protect against theft and fire. The safe should be heavy enough so it can’t be carried out of your home.First, there are no “fireproof” consumer safes on the market today. They are all fire resistant, meaning that they resist heat and smoke (and some protect against water) over a given period of time, usually 30 to 150 minutes.Fire-resistant safes are engineered and designed to protect paper and keep the internal temperature of the safe below 350 degrees, which is the critical temperature where paper will start to char and burn. Fire-resistant safes protect paper documents (and even small amounts of cash) from heat and smoke damage.Items you should keep in your home safe include: Safe-Deposit Boxes One way to decide what you should keep in a safe-deposit box is to include items you may not feel secure enough storing at home.Consider storing these items in a safe-deposit box:  This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

Every year, millions of people move – from one apartment to another, from an apartment to a home, or from one home to another. Moving is a stressful process, filled with dozens of logistical details and concerns. One set of concerns that many people never consider is whether and how their insurance will apply to their property and any motor vehicles they use during the move.Many people choose to hire professional movers. Even in experienced hands, moving creates several risks to personal property, including: Standard moving contracts limit the movers’ liability for damage to property of others to a certain value per pound, such as 50 or 60 cents. For example, if the movers drop a 100-pound sofa while loading it onto a truck, the most the mover will pay for it is $60. Also, the contracts often absolve the movers from liability for property damaged by “acts of God,” such as flooding, lightning strikes and hailstorms. While property owners can pay extra to upgrade the coverage, the upgrade normally values the property at its worth after depreciation, it may not cover breakage unless the movers packed the breakables, and it might not cover loss from certain causes such as flooding.If the owners still have a standard homeowner’s insurance policy in force, those same coverages apply if there is a loss to their property while the movers have it, while it is stored and while it is at the temporary home.  The owners have the option of buying coverage that will pay for replacing the property without depreciation.Many people, especially those purchasing a home for the first time, may rent trucks and move their property themselves. If they have a current homeowner’s or renter’s policy, it will provide the same coverage that the people moving from home to apartment to home have.  Renters should be sure to ask the rental company about purchasing insurance on the truck itself for liability they may incur for injuries or damages they cause while using the rental trucks.Moves can encompass many different circumstances. A family may buy a home but rent it back to the sellers for a period of weeks or months. Empty nesters may sell their freestanding house and move into a condominium. Families may move across the country, shipping some property by truck while they drive or fly to the new region. Regardless, people on the move should consider the insurance implications and discuss them with an insurance agent. Certain types of property (collectibles, musical instruments, artwork) may need special coverage not found in a homeowner’s policy, and a current homeowner’s policy may not cover a newly purchased home that is being rented back to the sellers. The agent can provide valuable guidance on these questions. Moving is stressful, but having the right insurance can make it a little less so.

In the Midwest, that means unpredictable cold weather and snow ahead. While the weather is still nice, it’s time for homeowners to start securing their homes for protection against wind, snow, ice and other harsh elements. The most common causes of damage to homes during the colder months are hail, rain and wind. Where to Start The roof is the best place to start when winter-proofing a home. All types of severe weather will stress shingles over time. Whether it is wind tugging at them or debris chipping at them, shingles must be kept in good condition or replaced as needed. Before the first freeze or snowstorm arrives, it is important to check the roof carefully to determine the condition of the shingles. Make any needed repairs as quickly as possible. Winterizing a Roof In addition to being damaged by harsh weather, a roof can become damaged by branches that fall onto it. This happens when trees are not regularly trimmed, and the result is often water leaking into the home itself. Over time, even a slow and unnoticeable leak can lead to extensive rotting. To keep the roof safe, follow these helpful tips: Winterizing a Basement When the roof is finished, check the basement next. Make an appointment to have the furnace inspected and cleaned each year, and be sure this is done by a qualified technician. Put insulation on all exposed water pipes. It is also helpful to keep the thermostat turned up during colder periods to prevent pipes from freezing and bursting. If there are any flammable materials in the basement, make sure they are stored away from wiring or heating units. Winterizing the Windows Leaky windows will let not only air but also snow and rain in the home. This can lead to big problems after a short period of time, so it is important to make sure the caulking around the windows and door frames is in good repair. Be sure to also check the caulking around sinks, bathtubs and toilets.After completing these tasks, it is prudent to walk around the house and look for other items that need repair. Look carefully at all appliances to see if they need to be serviced. Check the wiring to make sure it is in good repair. If there is a fireplace or wood-burning stove, have the chimney checked and cleaned every year when the colder months arrive. Clean under the dryer and its exhaust pipe to prevent fires. Look at all of the electrical outlets to ensure they do not have frayed wires or are loose. Check all carbon monoxide and smoke detectors, and replace the batteries if needed. Be sure to check them every month after that as well, and always keep a working fire extinguisher handy in the kitchen. Making sure the house is sealed up tight and is safe will help reduce the likelihood of having to file an insurance claim this winter. To learn more, discuss concerns with an agent.

Pipes can burst, snow can drift in if you have any holes that need repairing, and pests can enter the cottage. If you plan to button up your vacation home for the winter, you will want to take steps to protect it from these and other risks.The key is to be meticulous, which requires a detailed routine and a checklist so you don’t miss anything.If you do it right, you’ll reduce the chances of having a nasty surprise when you return in the spring. Start with the Outside The outside is a good place to start to ensure your vacation home is protected: Jettison the Water To help avoid damage from frozen water pipes, you should:Drain the water heater.Be careful during this process and turn off the circuit breaker for the heater before draining it. Close the cold-water intake before proceeding and, after you are done, make sure to close the hot-water tap.Drain the pipes.In many cottages, after you cut the power to the water pump, the water will drain out, but some water always remains, typically in the U-shaped traps under sinks. You can pour a healthy cup of anti-freeze into the drains (including sinks, baths, showers, laundry machine and toilet).Handy tip:If you plan to drain the pipes, consider attaching a hose to the lowest point in the plumbing and blowing out any water with an air compressor.Cut the water supply.This will ensure that a leak won’t develop.

The ability to rent a cozy room or home in your favorite city, or the opportunity to make a little money for an area of your home you are not currently using, seems like a win-win.If you’re thinking about cleaning out that old guest bedroom and transforming it into a comfy home away from home and placing it on a home-sharing site, here’s what you’ll need to know.First, find out if the host site you are working with offers any coverage for your home. Sites like Airbnb offer $1,000,000 of host protection insurance. Other sites may require you to provide your own coverage.Secondly, home insurance policies are created for the single family owner-occupied home. Regularly renting out a home is considered business use and requires a special dwelling fire policy. Meemic homeowner policies allow for rental of your property when it is rented occasionally for use as a residence and rented to no more than two roomers or borders. However, coverage is excluded when you participate in home-sharing networks and home-sharing host activities. Depending on how often the home is rented, the length of the rental, the number of occupants and the amount of money made annually from this service, it could result in a breach of the insurance contract.You should always speak with your Meemic agent or sales representative before engaging in any in-home businesses to make sure you’re properly covered.

Researchers also found that most (75%) of the people surveyed did not know they could obtain renter’s insurance for about the same monthly cost as a pair of movie tickets, and had therefore not purchased coverage for their possessions.They concluded that there was a clear misconception about how important it is to have renter’s insurance and the true cost of coverage. Leaving belongings at risk when about $20 per month can buy adequate coverage is an unwise move.Renters often live in properties with multiple units, and they may not always realize how high the risk of fires and other disasters are in these places.Although property owners are responsible for repairs to the structure in the event of most disasters, they are not responsible for tenants’ belongings. It is up to renters to make sure their possessions are protected.In their research, experts also found that about 40% of people without renter’s coverage did not think it was necessary. Nearly 70% of all young adult renters replied that the cost to replace all of their belongings would exceed $5,000. Renters who had coverage said they bought policies because they wanted the peace of mind to know they were protected.Renters’ biggest fears: Inexpensive peace of mind A plan that costs around $300 a year generally covers up to $50,000 worth of property. But most people won’t need that much coverage as renters. A policy that covers $15,000 to $20,000 worth of property should be enough for many people. Such policies can sometimes be had for less than $200 a year, or as little as $10 to $15 a month. Bundling with an auto policy can save even more. The best way to determine how much coverage to choose is to talk to an agent who will collect information about belongings. An agent can suggest how much coverage to buy based on the value of current possessions. An agent will also be glad to explain what certain terms mean. These are some additional issues to consider: If something happens to the rental unit that makes it uninhabitable for a period of time, renter’s insurance covers the additional cost of living elsewhere. Some examples of such damages include fires and toxic substances. Renter’s insurance is quick and easy to buy, and renters should make sure they always have it. To learn more about this type of coverage and how affordable it is, talk to an agent today. This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

According to The Knot.com, the custom began with the Romans, who believed that “the vein of love\" in the fourth finger of the left hand traveled directly to the heart.Today, couples still exchange rings as a symbol of love. Because your wedding ring has such deep sentimental value, you want to do all you can to take care of it. Here are some tips from DiamondHelpers.com: Another important way to protect your wedding ring is to have adequate insurance should it be lost or stolen. Start by examining your homeowners or renters insurance. Although this policy may cover your ring if it is stolen, there may be no coverage if it is lost. Read your policy carefully, as it may have a coverage limit for certain kinds of personal property, such as your wedding ring. If the value of your ring exceeds the policy limit, or if you want to ensure that you have coverage if the ring is lost, consider purchasing a rider.A rider is an endorsement to a homeowners or renters insurance policy that provides coverage for a particular piece of personal property. Items such as jewelry or furs whose full value is not covered under standard policies are typically covered by riders.Typically, the additional premium required to insure a wedding ring would be less than a dollar per $100 of appraised value. For example, a ring appraised for $10,000 would cost about $75-100 per year to insure.To request coverage, Meemic requires a current appraisal – within the last six years – under certain circumstances. Some experts recommend an appraisal every two years to make sure costs are up to date. It can get complicated, so talk to your agent about updating your policy to make sure you’re fully covered.Subject to underwriting eligibility requirements.

Know Your Insurance Obligations If you reside in a community that’s part of a homeowners association (HOA), you should understand what the association’s insurance obligations are relative to your own. If you don’t carefully assess this dynamic, you could find yourself with a coverage gap if you assume that the association’s insurance covers something it actually doesn’t. HOA rules usually require that all residents within the association’s jurisdiction become members and pay a fee. Associations can create their own bylaws for the community or building, and sometimes hire an outside property management company in order to enforce maintenance and other standards. HOA Obligations The association’s obligations will depend on the type of home you have: Single-Family, Detached Home The HOA most likely only owns community amenities, such as: Condominium The HOA typically owns the building, and you own the property inside your condo. In that case, the association’s insurance would likely cover: Know Who Is Responsible for What Your goal should be to ensure you have no coverage gaps. Start by reviewing your association’s bylaws and other documents, like CC&Rs. In some cases, your HOA’s rules might stipulate how much of a certain type of coverage you should carry or even which company you need to buy your policy from. It’s important to know this so you can judge whether a given condo or association is the right fit for you and to avoid penalties down the road. Condominiums For condominiums, two types of HOA coverage are common: Studs-out coverage:The most common condominium HOA coverage essentially includes everything outside of your unit’s drywall. The insurance would pay for damage to the building itself, like leaking roofs, an elevator breakdown or a tree falling into the side of the building. Your insurance, meanwhile, would cover everything inside your unit, including structural elements such as walls, fixtures, flooring and cabinets. All-in coverage:This protects the basic building and common areas, plus the structural elements and fixtures in your own unit. Having HOA all-in coverage likely means you’d need less individual coverage against property damage, as the only property you’d be responsible for are personal belongings (clothes, electronics, jewelry, etc.). Whatever you do, don’t skimp on the personal liability portion. A water leak or condo fire can become a much bigger loss in a condominium building since both tend to spread to other units. If that happens, it’s no longer a simple home insurance claim, but a potentially costly liability claim. This is why many HOAs require homeowners to maintain a minimum level of personal liability. Homes If you own a single-family, detached home, you will need to have traditional home insurance, as the HOA does not insure your dwelling. In this case, the HOA policy would normally cover mains in the streets as well as any clubhouse or parks. The Underinsured HOA Sometimes HOAs don’t carry enough insurance and members have to make up for the shortfall through assessments, which can be steep in the event of a significant loss. For HOA members, insurers offer “loss assessment” coverage, which will pay your share if the association does not have sufficient insurance to a covered loss.

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/why-meemic/blog/member-news/laura-chang-michigan-teacher-of-the-year: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Share This Article: Laura Chang Named Michigan Teacher of the Year Vicksburg’s Sunset Lake Elementary second grade teacher Laura Chang is described as “a model teacher who serves from the heart.” Today, Chang was announced as the 2018-19 Michigan Teacher of the Year (MTOY). Chang learned of her selection as the 2018-19 Michigan Teacher of the Year during a surprise visit from Interim State Superintendent Sheila Alles during a school visit to highlight the school’s academic success. Chang is the first MTOY from Kalamazoo County in program history.“Educators like Ms. Chang are key in moving Michigan to become a Top 10 education state in 10 years,” Alles said. “She is knowledgeable and provides relevant and meaningful teaching and learning experiences to her students. She is a compassionate, positive and inspirational role model.”“Preparing our young people to succeed in a healthy 21st century economy is becoming increasingly more important to their future achievement, and teachers like Ms. Chang – who are able to engage students at a young age – are exactly what our state and the students who call it home need,” Governor Rick Snyder said. “I appreciate the incredible work that Ms. Chang has done, and will continue to do, to prepare Michigan students to be successful later in life.”Vicksburg Community Schools Superintendent Charles Glaes described Chang as “that rare classroom teacher whom principals rely upon, parents lobby for, colleagues admire and enjoy working with, and students love.”Chang’s dedication to teaching truly is special, according to Sunset Lake principal Amie McCaw. “Laura has dedicated her life to education and helping others reach their goals,” McCaw said. “Although Laura serves in many different roles, she never lets the pressure get to her – she always serves with a smile. Laura's infectious laughter can be heard almost every morning and helps every one of us start our day on a positive note.”Chang has taught in Vicksburg Community Schools for her entire 18-year teaching career since receiving her Bachelor’s Degree from Western Michigan University (WMU). Chang also earned her Master of Arts in Education and Professional Development from WMU.Chang was selected by a panel of statewide education stakeholders following interviews with the 10 Regional Teachers of the Year. Each Regional Teacher of the Year presented a short professional development module before answering questions from panelists on topics including what motivates them as teachers, their approach to collaborating with peers and what they have done to ensure each student receives an equitable education in Michigan.The Michigan Department of Education (MDE) uses the MTOY program to recognize outstanding educators across the state and create an avenue for them to share their voice with MDE and other education stakeholders as we work together to make Michigan a Top 10 education state in 10 years.As MTOY, Chang will chair the Michigan Teacher Leadership Advisory Committee (MTLAC), which comprises of each year’sRegional Teachers of the Year. During their year of service, the MTLAC will work with MDE and other Michigan educational stakeholders to find solutions facing Michigan’s education system issues, while ensuring that the voice of teachers is present in these discussions.In addition, the State Board of Education honors the MTOY with a non-voting seat at the board table during its regular monthly meetings, allowing the MTOY to engage with board members in discussions on how best to move Michigan's education system forward. Financial support for the program is provided by The Meemic Foundation, which is celebrating its 12th year as the proud sponsor of the MTOY program.“Meemic Insurance Company is honored to recognize Laura Chang for her passion and the endless contributions she has made in supporting not only student excellence, but also her role as a teacher-leader,” said Pamela R. Harlin, Director of The Meemic Foundation. “Michigan is fortunate to have nine Regional Teachers of the Year that will support Laura in representing educators throughout the state.  Their collective efforts provide the unique opportunity for all Michigan educators to enrich their professional development while engaging more in issues vital to Michigan’s education success.”Sunset Lake Elementary in Vicksburg Community Schools will receive a monetary award from Meemic in honor of Chang’s recognition as MTOY, to be used for the advancement of education. The school of each Regional Teacher of the Year will receive a plaque commemorating the accomplishment of their teacher.Chang and the nine other Regional Teachers of the Year will be recognized by the State Board of Education during its August 14 meeting.

On May 8, Lougheed’s impact and reach spread exponentially across the state when she was named the 2019-20 Michigan Teacher of the Year (MTOY). Lougheed learned of her once-in-a-lifetime honor, awarded by the Michigan Department of Education (MDE), from Interim State Superintendent Sheila Alles during a surprise, all-school assembly. “Ms. Lougheed has an incredible ability to forge meaningful relationships with those around her, whether it’s students in her English class, or college students she’s mentoring to become our next generation of educators,” Alles said. “She cares about their long-term success, both inside and outside the classroom, and provides them with the tools necessary to be lifelong learners. She is an inspirational educator who truly embodies what it means to put students first.” Governor Gretchen Whitmer offered that, “Ms. Lougheed has dedicated her life to helping our students get ahead. Throughout her more than two decades of teaching, she has touched countless lives and inspired her students and colleagues. Michigan is a great state because of the dedicated teachers like Cara who work tirelessly to make sure their students get a great public education. I’m proud to congratulate her on her outstanding service to our state, and am committed to making sure Cara and teachers everywhere are treated with the respect they deserve.” Lougheed began her teaching career at Rochester High School in 1998 and was a founding staff member of Stoney Creek High School when it opened in the fall of 2001. Lougheed is a Western Michigan University alumnus, with a bachelor’s degree in Secondary Education, and also a graduate of Nova Southeastern University, where she earned a Master of Arts in Teaching and Learning. Outside of the classroom, Lougheed has served as a Social Studies teacher leader, building activities director, district union representative, and a National Education Association delegate. She has worked collaboratively with colleagues and administrators to write curriculum, design an attendance incentive program for students, and contribute to various projects aimed at increasing student connectedness and improving school culture. Lougheed’s selection as the 2019-20 MTOY comes after a months-long, multi-level competitive process. She was one of more than 400 teachers nominated for the award in the fall of 2018. The field was narrowed twice and Lougheed was named one of the state’s 10Regional Teachers of the Year (RTOY)in April. Of the 10 finalists, Lougheed was chosen to receive the state’s top honors. As MTOY, Lougheed will lead Michigan’s Teacher Leadership Advisory Committee (MTLAC), which comprises the year’s RTOYs. During its year of service, the group works directly with the MDE and other Michigan educational stakeholders to find solutions to issues facing the state’s education system, ensuring that the voice of teachers is present in these discussions. In addition, Lougheed will serve as an advocate and spokesperson for more than 100,000 teachers statewide and engage in discussions on how best to move Michigan's education system forward – with a non-voting seat at monthly State Board of Education meetings, and a member of the newly-formed Governor’s Educator Advisory Council. Lougheed also is the state’s candidate for the prestigious National Teacher of the Year honor. Program expenses for the Michigan Teacher of the Year, as well as the Regional Teachers of the Year and Michigan Teacher Leadership Advisory Council, are covered through the generous support of the Meemic Foundation, now celebrating its 13th year as the program’s sponsor. Meemic also presents each RTOY’s school with a plaque commemorating the outstanding accomplishment of their teacher. “Today’s announcement marks the beginning of a year-long journey of learning, leading and collaboration for Cara Lougheed and Meemic Insurance Company is honored to be a part of it,” said Pamela R. Harlin, Director of the Meemic Foundation. “We are proud of the transformational and inspiring work being done by Cara and the Regional Teachers of the Year, as well as countless teachers in classrooms across the state. Michigan’s hard-working educators are changing lives every day and their contributions to our schools, communities, and state as a whole, deserve to be recognized time and again.” Cultivating recognition programs and other educator recognition initiatives is an important part of MDE’s efforts to develop, support and sustain a high-quality, prepared, and collaborative education workforce – part of the department’s collective goal to make Michigan a Top 10 education state in 10 years. Lougheed, along with the nine other Regional Teachers of the Year, will be recognized formally by the State Board of Education during its August 13 meeting in Lansing.

Porter is a kindergarten teacher at Wilcox Elementary in Holt and will be entering her 16th year of teaching in the fall.“Ms. Porter is a life-changing educator who has been serving her community for 16 years and counting,” said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. “We are thrilled to honor Ms. Porter as Michigan’s 2021 Teacher of the Year and grateful to educators who consistently go above and beyond for their kids every year. Thank you, Ms. Porter, for creating a space for students to, in your own words, have the freedom to be themselves and be celebrated for all that they are.”Since 1952, one of Michigan’s outstanding teachers has been named Michigan Teacher of the Year and been offered opportunities to serve as an advocate for the teaching profession at the state level. The Michigan Teacher of the Year program is not about finding the “best teacher,” an impossible task; instead, it is about celebrating an outstanding member of the teaching profession and giving Michigan teachers a voice at the state level.“Congratulations to Ms. Porter, who represents all the great teachers we have in Michigan,” Dr. Rice said. “The Michigan Teacher of the Year is an important advocate and ally for teachers and students. We appreciate and will benefit from Ms. Porter and her experiences as we work to improve Michigan public education.”Porter’s selection as the 2021-22 MTOY comes after a months-long, multi-level competitive process that started with the nomination of more than 275 teachers in the fall of 2020. The field was narrowed twice, and Porter was named one of the state’s 10 Regional Teachers of the Year (RTOY) in April. Each RTOY then interviewed with a panel of statewide education stakeholders, where each presented a short professional development module and answered questions on a range of topics relevant to issues faced by teachers today.In her application, Porter described her aspirations for students.“In my greatest dreams, I see an educational system that allows each child the freedom to be themselves, to have security and trust in their learning spaces, and to be celebrated for all that they are,” Porter wrote.The 10 RTOYs will work together during the upcoming school year as the 2021-22 Michigan Teacher Leadership Advisory Committee (MTLAC), comprising the year’s RTOY cohort. During their year of service, group members work directly with MDE and other Michigan educational stakeholders to develop solutions to issues facing the state’s education system, to ensure that the voices of teachers are present in these discussions.In addition to her work on the MTLAC, Porter will serve as an advocate for, and representative of, the more than 86,000 public school teachers statewide and engage in discussions on how best to continue to improve Michigan's education system as a non-voting member of the State Board of Education and a member of the Governor’s Educator Advisory Council. Porter is also the state’s candidate for the prestigious 2022 National Teacher of the Year honor.Program expenses for the MTOY, as well as the RTOY and MTLAC, are offset through the generous support of The Meemic Foundation, now celebrating its 15th year as the program’s sponsor. The Meemic Foundation presents each RTOY and his or her school with a plaque commemorating the accomplishment.“As we proudly approach our 15th year as the MTOY program sponsor, The Meemic Foundation is honored to join MDE in recognizing Leah Porter as the new Michigan Teacher of the Year as well as celebrating the achievements of the other nine RTOYs,” said Pam R. Harlin, director of The Meemic Foundation. “Even in a year that certainly will continue to be filled with challenges around each corner, the diverse backgrounds and passion of these teacher leaders will prove valuable as the teachers serve as voices for all Michigan educators and students. Meemic remains committed to supporting Michigan education and salutes the unwavering dedication of all educators.”Porter and her fellow RTOYs will be formally recognized by the State Board of Education during a future board meeting.

Defeat the Label is partnering with the NEA and AFT to bring the awareness campaign to a larger audience. Details are still being hammered out, but a toolkit should be available by the end of the month atDefeatTheLabel.com/Stand4Change-2024. Keep an eye on our socials for more news on both events!

Candice is an English Language Arts teacher at Rochester High School and will be entering her 20th year of teaching in the fall. “Kelley is passionate, nurturing, and relentless in her efforts to support our students,” said RHS principal Joshua Wrinkle. “Some of the most inspiring work that I’ve witnessed in education includes Kelley’s ability to encourage and support students who may be struggling, have disabilities or are not excited about the course work. She is always looking for ways to motivate her students to achieve more than they ever thought they could. She seeks ways to not only better her own instruction, but to also support her colleagues in their growth. The future of education is strong because of dedicated teachers like Kelley.” The Power of ​Read-Alouds in Elementary & Secondary Classes March is one of the most exciting times during the school year. It is the month we celebrate reading in every elementary classroom in the nation. We spend an enormous amount of time transforming schools into extraordinary places where vibrant storybook characters come to life. Sheer passion and sparkle bring life to the many marvelous texts we have grown to love and emulate in our daily practices. ​Reading Month elevates literacy into an electrifying championship where students compete and celebrate the remarkable experiences that text and teachers provide them. One of the most powerful literary opportunities we provide to children is our ability to make a read-aloud become something magical. In elementary schools, read-alouds are part of daily practice. A shared, meaningful literacy experience often awaits students as they return from afternoon activities. Teachers can use text to morph classroom rugs into dynamic literacy- and language-rich experiences as students ride magic carpets throughout the classroom during a read-aloud.​ Reading Month​ provides opportunities for us, as teachers, to magnify these experiences into brilliant and memorable activities; however, we shouldn’t let it stop at the elementary level any longer. 12 Teachers Share Their Most Important Books When The Meemic Foundation offered a grant for teachers to spend on Scholastic books, the main question on the application was: “What books impacted you the most – as a child and as an educator?” We got some great responses. And in honor of National Reading Month in March, we’re sharing some of our favorites. Meemic Educator Celebrates Music in Our Schools Month Music is fundamentally different from any other subject we’re taught in school. Unlike many other course types, you can’t cram for a musical performance like you can a written exam. You can't stay up the night before a concert practicing like you can pull an “all nighter” for an English essay. There’s a built-in mechanism where diligent, consistent effort is needed to sound proficient – and I think that’s a terrific thing. In a society that tends toward instant gratification, music helps students learn the lesson of persistence while working toward a goal. Got Kids? Work Play into Your Exercise Routine to Stay on Track Exhausted. Tired. House is a mess after our kids pull out every toy that we own. Kids are a tornado that can hit at any moment without notice.

Meemic Volunteers Add More Flair to OLHSA The Head Start is operated in a former corporate building for one of the auto manufacturers. When you walk in, the walls are decorated with posters advertising the many services OLHSA offers to families. As you continue through the building, you’ll notice that there are stretches of beige, sterile walls in between clusters of students’ artwork. Last year, to make it more kid-friendly, we painted murals on some of the walls. This year, we decided to add more color to the halls to continue to brighten up the spaces. Spring Fever: Maintain Work-life Balance When Life Is “Life-ing” Spring Fever is in full bloom, and teachers everywhere are looking forward to the end of the school year.

Although the teachers who mentioned this were usually music educators themselves, I don’t think this observation was tongue-in-cheek. Working as a music instructor (in addition to being a Meemic agent), my own experiences have borne this out, as well. Music is fundamentally different from any other subject we’re taught in school. Unlike many other course types, you can’t cram for a musical performance like you can a written exam. You can't stay up the night before a concert practicing like you can pull an “all nighter” for an English essay. There’s a built-in mechanism where diligent, consistent effort is needed to sound proficient – and I think that’s a terrific thing. In a society that tends toward instant gratification, music helps students learn the lesson of persistence while working toward a goal. Music also helps bring people together, but not in a way that’s superficial. If students want their ensemble to sound its very best, they need to care about how their peers sound, too. This investment in a group, rather than just oneself, helps build relationships in a way not found in a lecture hall. With teamwork being a necessary component of most jobs and workplaces, music students can take their experiences from school and apply them after graduation and beyond. According topbs.org, music education is also beneficial for language development, increasing one’s IQ, improving test scores and giving your brain a workout. I could go on and on about the benefits of learning an instrument or how to sing, but here’s the takeaway from this post: music pupils are fantastic students, so don’t be surprised if they’re among the top achievers in their school. Adam Stowe of the Stowe Insurance Agency is a music instructor for the Jackson Symphony Orchestra School of Music.

This report really tugged at my heart strings and made me realize something very valuable. Although the report highlighted new research regarding the increase in the frequency of parent read-alouds at home (since 2014), it also included information that was shocking. The report noted that the frequency of parent read-alouds in the home dropped significantly after the age of 5, and then again after the age of 8. It was reported that only 17 percent of children between the ages of 9 and 11 participated in read-alouds with a parent in the home environment. I am guilty of this, as well. As my own children grew older and became proficient readers, I stopped reading aloud to them. This reality really hurt and hit home for me. I didn’t realize the significance of this until it was right in front of me. Most importantly, I know this is happening in secondary classrooms as well; read-alouds are rarely part of daily instruction. As teachers we know the importance of read-alouds in the classroom and at home, and we must keep this momentum going strong for ​all​ age levels. This need is truly supported when you think about the rise in adult “audible” or “read to me” texts that are downloaded every year. There seems to remain one constant – we all, at any age, love to partake in read-aloud experiences. We are learning that as children become independent readers, adults are ceasing to read-aloud to them. In the report “​From Striving to Thriving​,” the authors stress the importance of having students listen to a proficient reader read, daily, in the classroom. Teachers need to model prosody, metacognition, inquiry and so much more as part of an instructional routine. Most importantly, this needs to be occurring daily, in ​all​ K-12 classrooms. Furthermore, teachers can use any form of text during read-alouds. The texts that educators choose to use for read-alouds at the elementary level can also be used at the secondary level to provide joyful literary experiences. For example, early picture books can be used as a read-aloud choice for students in both early and later grades. These books capture the rhythm and rhyme of early print; however, they also can contain complex text structures and themes. These components are excellent springboards for discussion and book talks in the classroom. Additionally, the cadence of the English language can be found through volumes of diverse text; students can benefit from read-alouds from any genre. Every. Single. Day. When planning practices that encompass read-alouds, students’ age, grade level and reading level should never be considered the only factors. Shared interactive read-alouds should be embedded into daily instruction. These practices provide opportunities for students to develop strong reading competencies through listening, inquiry and talk. If we read compelling and joyful books to our students and then surround them with unlimited access to irresistible texts of choice, we will foster a community of remarkable readers. Our students will savor every experience we provide with jubilant enthusiasm and engaged persistence. There are many ways to include read-alouds in the elementary and secondary classroom. Some of these activities may include: Students of ​all​ ages deserve to celebrate joyful reading opportunities throughout the month of March. Reading Month is a time to empower students to fall in love with reading all over again. You can do this by creating instructional time that focuses on exemplary integration of innovative read-aloud activities. Now is the time to transform your school, classroom and students -- because in March, reading is always magical.

Sticking to our roots and our mission of serving the educational community, we usually take on projects at local schools or other educational facilities. This year, we revisited the Oakland Livingston Human Services Agency (OLHSA) Head Start in Pontiac. The OLHSA Head Start program makes sure young children have access to the nutritional, medical and educational services they need, and provides them with opportunities inside and outside of the classroom they might not otherwise have access to. Meemic first had the opportunity to assist the organization last year. We painted murals on the walls, planted small gardens and installed privacy panels to their fencing. The Head Start is operated in a former corporate building for one of the auto manufacturers. When you walk in, the walls are decorated with posters advertising the many services OLHSA offers to families. As you continue through the building, you’ll notice that there are stretches of beige, sterile walls in between clusters of students’ artwork. Last year, to make it more kid-friendly, we painted murals on some of the walls. This year, we decided to add more color to the halls to continue to brighten up the spaces.Prior to the event, four Meemic employees went to the building and sketched the designs on to the walls. The designs were abstract shapes running down a stretch of the hallways on three floors. Each hallway design would comprise two colors.On the Saturday of the event, all of the employees who volunteered met at the building at 8 a.m. We met with Linda, a director at the Head Start who helped us coordinate, and Susan, the CEO. Once in the building, we unpacked the supplies and divided up in to teams. My team was assigned the third floor. We grabbed our supplies and paint, and headed upstairs. When the elevator door opens to the third floor, you’re greeted with a scene from outer space: A pale moon shines against a gray sky, while a red and white rocket ship blasts through the stars, heading towards a spaceship piloted by bright green aliens. The outer space mural, painted last year, had become the backdrop to a cozy reading lounge for the students. Around the corner was the hallway with sketched designs labeled “pink” and “yellow.” We unraveled our drop cloths and taped them on the floor beneath each set of designs. We divided up the paint brushes and paint, and got started. Our first coat was completed after an hour. While waiting for the first coat to dry, we began to work on other small projects around the building. I went outside to the playground and pulled weeds, while others dusted the classrooms. The walls dried, and the second coat of paint was applied. Each floor looked so cool! The first floor, which included an undersea mural, had white and sky blue designs painted down the hallway. The second floor had yellow and green designs, a bright contrast with the deep colors in the forest life mural. The final floor, my floor, had bright pink and yellow designs, also a vivid contrast to the outer space mural. Working for an organization that helps out in the community is truly rewarding. I can’t wait to volunteer again!

Work Play into Your Exercise Routine to Stay on Track Exhausted. Tired. House is a mess after our kids pull out every toy that we own.Kids are a tornado that can hit at any moment without notice. Not only do they destroy our house, but they suck up all of our energy and time. Of course, we still love them, right? This is our crazy, fun, yet exhausting, life.After we have taken care of our kids, we must find time to take care of ourselves. When we barely have time to see friends, read or watch Netflix, we must try to squeeze in a workout – usually at the end of a full workday, which includes grading papers, working on lesson plans, and having virtual meetings with parents or students in addition to meal preparation and household chores. Not to mention our favorite activity, which is playing with our kids.This is the lesson that I have learned through being a parent over the past three years: It is all about PLAY! I want to live a long, healthy and fun-filled life with my children. For this reason, I have learned how to incorporate play time into my fitness routine. Utilizing fitness trackers and home workout apps, my family is heading in a healthy direction. When we are playing on the floor or wrestling with the kids, we are doing a workout alongside them, including variations of burpees, push-ups, planks or squats. The kids see these activities and want to be a part of them.Mystery workouts can be exciting, as well. Try using workout dice specifically designed for young children, which can offer numerous combinations of activities that will get everyone moving and improve balance, flexibility and motor skills. Our daughter will enthusiastically do jumping jacks now. Our son is the perfect size for a kettlebell when we are doing squats.As a family, we enjoy going on walks, hikes, jogs and runs outside with our dog. For winter, we now bundle up with snow pants and other waterproof gear to stay warm. Our 3-year-old daughter has become one of my favorite running partners. While she can’t necessarily run long distances, she loves to sprint with me back and forth throughout our yard.If sprinting doesn’t sound fun, try going on a walk or jog while your little one rides a bike or scooter. We listen to music, sing and have an amazing time together. Sometimes we will stop in the grass to do yoga stretches. She always tells me, “We have some fun, Daddy.”Not only are we having fun together, but we are developing our relationship with healthy activities. Overall, when we are outside, we are happy.Unfortunately, the Greater Detroit Area is often ranked as one of the unhealthiest places in the United States. Studies show that exercise not only improves our physical health, but it can also help our mental health.I believe in the magic of working out. It is my meditation. It relieves my stress. It helps me feel better physically and mentally. I want to pass this passion on to my kids.In a time where we are social distancing and everyday life is not the same, we need to take care of ourselves both physically and mentally. The quarantine life can lead to anxiety and depression and one way we can combat this issue is with fitness. We show our kids how and why it is important to brush our teeth. Why not show them the importance of physical activity?

What a great time to celebrate our student musicians:  the kids who have dedicated countless hours to mastering their craft, to learning to read foreign languages, to practicing their dexterity, to excelling in a world of constant change. A world where everyone gets to be a part of the team. Where every player is just as important as the next player. Where teamwork is the basis for everything.Music rooms across the world are the true collaborative classrooms: students working side by side to play or sing together, making everything work at just the right time, and at just the right pitch and volume. Coordination of breath control, muscle control, eye-ear-hand coordination, it all takes years to perfect. Whether you have a young singer, a recorder karate champion, a marching band member, cellist or vocalist, or play the radio, music is a part of everyone's life. Imagine a movie without a soundtrack, a Super Bowl without a halftime show; even talk radio uses intro music! Music truly is a common thread; it really is everywhere.Music students are among the most disciplined students. A student who takes lessons for six years typically shows an increase in IQ of seven points, according to a University of Zurich study. Music students typically score higher on standardized tests!I would be remiss if I didn’t give a shout-out to all the great music teachers out there. From concerts in small rural towns to performances at the Met, action movies to love scenes, baseball walk-up music to Olympic ceremonies, without you, there would be silence in the world. Thank you for all you do!I encourage everyone to attend a school concert. Listen to a group of first-graders, attend a spring concert and next time you’re at a high school football game, watch the halftime show and cheer like it was the game-winning touchdown.March is Music in Our Schools Month, but music happens in schools every day. Celebrate! Chip Williams taught middle school and high school band and choir for 21 years. He and his wife, Kerri, own the Williams Insurance Agency of Southeast Michigan in Monroe, MI. They opened their office in 2016, and Chip retired from teaching in June 2017.   Related Articles 12 Teachers Share Their Most Important Books Got Kids?

And in honor of National Reading Month in March, we’re sharing some of our favorites. “I fell in love with the‘Little House’series as a child. I also loved Beverly Cleary books. I use these books in my classroom. We even make butter like they did in ‘the olden days’ to celebrate the end of ‘Little House in the Big Woods.’ We then use the butter on a pancake breakfast.”Dawn V., Big Bend, WI “When I was younger, I could not get enough of the‘Nancy Drew’series or the‘Trixie Belden’series. I loved mysteries. Then, I went through a period in my teen years of enjoying romance or horror. There was not a lot of quality teen fiction when I was young. It has only been as an adult that I have seen the genre explode. Through books such as‘Touching Spirit Bear,’ ‘The Giver’or‘The Last Book in the Universe,’I have been able to open the world of reading to students who otherwise would never think to touch a book.”Andrea P., Wyoming, MI “As a child, the books of Judy Blume were influential in my wanting to read chapter books.  As an adult, many books have influenced me, but one in particular that was pivotal is‘Esperanza Rising’by Pam Munoz Ryan. This is one of the books that I read in preparation for taking the Target Language Proficiency test that was required for my certification.”Tammee P., Beardstown, IL “‘Harry Potter’of course! Every child should be imbued with a sense of empowerment and wonder at a young age. The themes of loyalty, determination and doing the right thing are still with me today.”\r\n",
            "Colleen S., Woodridge, IL “How can I choose only a few? As a teen, I fell in love with‘To Kill a Mockingbird.’In college, I was required to read a LOT of picture books and young adult books. I love children's books because they make difficult concepts accessible to children. Today, my favorites include‘Harry Potter,’‘A Series of Unfortunate Events,’‘The Crossover,’‘Wonder’and books with diverse characters.”\r\n",
            "Robin B., Milwaukee, WI “I loved‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’since I was very young. I was always intrigued by an author that could come up with such a unique story with strange characters. I still read it!”\r\n",
            "Jamie S., Byron Center, MI “The books that really impacted me as a child were the‘Calvin and Hobbes’series. The‘Harry Potter’series and the‘Chronicles of Narnia.’I try to stay with the times and what the students are reading. As an educator, I really looked towards Deepak Chopra books to enlighten me about everyday things that happen and to get a new perspective on life.”\r\n",
            "Bart P., Chicago, IL “There are several books that impacted me the most as a child and as an educator. First and foremost was‘Matilda.’I could relate to Matilda finding solace in books, and it caused me to enjoy reading even more than I already did. I often found escape in the story, and went through many copies of the book. Additionally,‘The Giving Tree’is another book that really impacted me as a child. It taught me to always be generous in spirit and give whatever I am able to. Further, and most importantly of all, it taught me that no matter what status you currently are in life, there is always something you can contribute. As an educator, I think texts by Dr. Ross Greene,‘The Explosive Child’being foremost, have really provided me a wonderful foundation and changed the way that I view and interact with children with emotional and behavioral disorders.”\r\n",
            "Barry W., Stevens Point, WI “As a child, a maroon bound book of diverse poetry styles was my favorite. It was given to me by a school librarian who was a published poet and encouraged me to write. I also enjoyed reading‘Anne of Green Gables’and discussing the book with my mother.  As an educator, my favorite book for students is‘Wonder’by R.J. Palacio. It opens the eyes of intermediate students to a broader world around them and the struggles some go through. As an educator, my favorite book for colleagues is‘Mindsets in the Classroom.’”\r\n",

For too long, women have been advocating for themselves and fighting for equality and opportunity in all aspects of life. Women have made huge strides in education, and helped influence changes and bring awareness to unique issues in the system. From the push to accepting neurodiversity in students, to demanding girls all over the world having access to education, these women deserve recognition for their contributions to education. Ruby Bridges “Don’t follow the path. Go where there is no path and begin the trail. When you start a new trail equipped with courage, strength and conviction, the only thing that can stop you is you.” A picture of strength and courage at only 6 years old, Ruby Bridges was the first black child in a desegregated school. On her first day, she was escorted into school by federal marshals. Ruby was greeted by angry adults, spewing racism and throwing objects at her, hoping to frighten her. Parents did not allow their children to attend school in protest. Due to parents’ protests, Ruby was isolated from the rest of her classmates. She continued to be escorted by federal marshals and was greeted with a new threat every day. A woman threatened to poison her, another brought a coffin with a black doll in it to show Ruby. Even in the face of vile hatred, she persisted. Eventually, people stopped protesting. She continued her education through high school. Later on, she became a liaison at her old elementary school and found a new passion. After discovering that children needed their parents to take an active role in their education to succeed, she started the Ruby Bridges Foundation, which aspires to provide children with an equal opportunity to succeed in education.

And the wonderful thing is that once a child learns to use a library, the doors to learning are always open.” Every First Lady chooses an issue to be passionate about, and Laura Bush’s was the education of the nation’s children. Before her husband was elected president, he was the governor of Texas. During his time as governor, Laura advocated for state funding for early childhood education, which included literacy and development programs. She was successful in her endeavor. Laura was passionate about children’s access to public libraries and raised nearly $1 million in funding. During her husband’s tenure as president, Laura used the national platform to advocate for higher salaries for teachers and better training for Head Start programs. She created the initiative “Ready to Read, Ready to Learn,” which promoted reading at an early age. After leaving the White House, Laura Bush continues to advocate for improvements in education and children’s access to public libraries and other resources.

She used her knowledge to help improve the quality of life of livestock. Temple was a strong supporter of autistic children receiving a more tailored education. She advocated retraining teachers to recognize each child’s specific fixation and use that to help them learn. She recommended early intervention in learning and promoted neurodiversity. Autism was not something to be “cured,” but something to be harnessed.

Communities suffered, as did education. Kira Orange Jones, a Bronx native, began an initiative to reinvent schools in New Orleans. The Teach for America executive director encouraged educators from all over the country to assist in rebuilding New Orleans’ education system. The diverse set of teachers helped each other develop innovative teaching styles, which in turn benefited the students. Since 2005, the high school graduation rate has climbed to 75% from 50%, with the number of graduates attending college doubling. Due to Kira’s education model, New Orleans’ students now outperforms Chicago, Denver and Miami on ACT tests.

Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.” Helen Keller is a crusader. Stricken with an illness that left her deaf and blind at 19 months old, Helen had many struggles to overcome. Through the help of her teacher, Anne Sullivan, Helen was able to learn to communicate and attend school. Overcoming her disabilities pushed her into the public eye. She published her first book while in college, detailing her early life and education. She went on to publish four more books on her personal experiences, and many more on social issues and religion. Helen used her celebrity to advocate for the education of those who were blind. She also made the public aware of significant issues that came with blindness. In 1924, she joined the staff of the American Foundation for the Blind, an organization that helps those who are blind access life-improving resources. Due to her advocacy, the organization became well-known and attracted many donors. Today, the organization is still a popular resource for those who are blind. Helen Keller changed the way people view those with disabilities, and helped shape the education aimed towards those who are blind.

While the director of the Orthophrenic School for developmentally disabled children, she began to study early childhood development and education. She implemented her idea of allowing children’s natural interests to take lead in education and saw an improvement in the children’s development that led her to test her teaching methods on other children. She was placed in a school called the Children’s House and created a “prepared learning” environment, using her ideas from the Orthophrenic School. As she continued to teach, she tweaked her method. Eventually, “Montessori Schools” opened in the United States as an alternative method of learning and are still active today.

A teacher herself, she continued leading classes at Northern Virginia Community College while Joe Biden was president. She started at NVCC in 2009 and hosted the first White House Summit on Community Colleges in 2010, while her husband was Vice President. While Second Lady, she also led the 2012 Community College to Career bus tour and co-founded the Book Buddies program. As First Lady, she advocated for vaccination and worked on efforts to safely reopen school during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. She started her education career teaching English to teens in a psychiatric hospital and later taught for three years at Claymont High School and Delaware Technical and Community College. She earned two master’s degrees and a doctorate in education.

She was born in Liberia but left the country during a regressive regime. The leader of Liberia was waging war against its neighbors and using the nation’s children to fight. She protested these actions consistently and was nearly jailed twice. After leaving, she continued to keep abreast of any developments, especially in government. After resistance from the international community, the regime ended. Sirleaf returned to Liberia to help rebuild the country. In 2006, she was sworn in as president. The rebuilding of Liberia started with the reduction of Liberia’s debt.  Once the country became stronger, President Sirleaf focused on education and healthcare in an effort to increase the literacy rates and, subsequently, lower the poverty rate. She enacted free elementary education for all Liberian children and introduced Freedom of Information laws, being the fourth country in Africa to do so. In 2011, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts in rebuilding a country torn apart by war.

Each time you fail, start all over again, and you will grow stronger until you have accomplished a purpose – not the one you began with perhaps, but one you’ll be glad to remember.” Many teachers know that with some students, persistence is the key to unlocking their potential. Anne Sullivan is best known for her work with Helen Keller, a woman who was both blind and deaf. Anne had her fair share of adversity in her life. At a young age, she contracted an eye disease that severely damaged her sight. After her mother died, her father abandoned her and her siblings, leaving them to grow up as orphans in a community house for the poor. After learning that there were special schools for those who were blind, Anne was insistent on getting an education and escaping poverty. She went on to attend Perkins School for the Blind and graduated valedictorian. At 20, she went to work with Helen Keller. Helen was a difficult student, but Anne pushed her to succeed. In months, Helen learned almost 600 words, most of her multiplication tables and how to read braille. With Anne’s unwavering support, Helen went on to be the first deaf-blind person to graduate from college.

One child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world.” At only 15 years old, Malala Yousafzai became a household name after surviving a gunshot to the head. As a child, Malala began to advocate for girls to be able to receive an education. Even after the Taliban issued a death threat to her, she stood her ground and continued to fight. On October 9, 2012, she was shot by a Taliban gunman and survived. After recovering, she persisted in her crusade to arm girls with an education. On her 16th birthday, she gave a speech at the United Nations, urging leaders to become more progressive in education and women’s rights. At the age of 17, she became the youngest person to win a Nobel Peace Prize.

Remember, too, that after the New Year, robbers are on the prowl, looking for opportunities to make off with the new stuff you got for Christmas. 1. Childproof your home, even if you have older kids You can change the way you protect your kids in the home as they age.Babies and toddlers:Install cabinet locks to prevent babies from getting into places with household chemicals and cleaners, or your liquor.Install cordless blinds or curtains throughout your home to prevent choking.Young children:With young children, make sure you have non-slip rugs in the bathroom.Also, one common injury for the little ones is burns and scalds. Keep a close eye on your children whenever they are near things that can burn them like ovens and stoves, heaters, the fireplace and other appliances and products that may get hot, such as curling irons or hair straighteners.Pre-teens:- As the kids get older, subtler and unseen dangers await them, especially as most of them are using computers, smartphones or tablets to play games, socialize and surf the Internet.You may want to install parental controls on the computer and have a talk with your kids about sharing personal information - and also about talking to strangers online. 2. Keep your valuables safe Home burglaries increase after the holidays, so if you have some expensive jewelry, cash, collections or other valuables you don’t want to go missing, you should store them in a fireproof safe.Other items you should consider storing in the safe include the deed to your home, wills, birth certificates, passports and any other important documents you don’t want to lose.The fireproof part is important since fires, floods and other disasters can damage or destroy those documents. 3. Close the garage door Drive down most any neighborhood during the day and you are likely to see at least one house with the garage door open and nobody in sight.By leaving your garage doors open unattended you might as well hang a sign that says, “Free stuff. Come and get it.”Also, if you are going to be away for any extended period of time, you should consider disabling your garage door. 4. Start a neighborhood watch You may have nosy neighbors who annoy you, but they could suddenly become your best friend if they catch a stranger snooping around the outside of your house.If you are concerned about the potential for break-ins, you can start by getting acquainted with your neighbors and encourage them to check in on each other and promise not to ignore alarms that go off, watch for strangers wandering and loitering in the neighborhood and notify one another of suspicious activity.You can even make it formal by proposing a neighborhood watch program. 5. Keep emergency numbers by all phones If your older kids are home alone, you should make it easy for them to react if there is an emergency. Make sure your child has easy access to this information: This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

It may sound like a daunting task to just get started, but fortunately TWS Home Inventory and Asset Management Group has created this handy list to help you take stock of your stuff.  Steps to Take Read your policy and discuss it with your agent:You need to understand your policy so you can know if you are covered for the replacement value of your possessions or only actual cash value, or whether you need any special riders or endorsements for specialty items, such as: Take photos of the outside of the home:Shoot the property from all sides, including any landscaping, outdoor furniture and accoutrements. Take photos of each room from all angles:Make sure your pictures cover every piece of furniture, art and other decorations in every room. Open every closet, cupboard and drawer:Go through all the places that you keep your possessions and, if you find anything of value, document it. Document when and where you got it and how much you paid for it. If you haven't gotten in the habit of doing so, keep receipts for all of your big purchases. Don't forget to photograph and document your clothes. If you have any expensive items, like fur coats, business suits or fancy dresses, take separate photos of them. Note the model and serial number of electronic items:Take pictures and list the details of computers, mobile phones, tablets, TVs, stereo systems, etc. Pay extra attention to china, crystal and silver:If you have a fancy set of china and cutlery, place it all on a table and take a picture. Take pics of the front and back of your plates, to show the brand name and the pattern. Cover the garage, as well:Often people have more valuables in their garage than any other place in their home. Again take pictures of everything in there – your tools, equipment, sporting goods, bikes, etc. Photograph family heirlooms:Include rare items you have inherited when taking pictures. Even though insurance can't replace the sentimental value, it may replace the cost of those items. Scan all receipts:Get into the habit of scanning your receipts and taking a picture of the item to keep with your receipt. Keep things organized with one folder for each room. Keep inventory off-premises:You should have a home inventory at home, but also keep one off your premises. These days that's quite easy, since you can store it on the cloud with a free service like dropbox.com.

The problem: By the time water damage becomes visible from inside the home, there may already be extensive rot and mildew between the ceiling and roof. All of a sudden, instead of just replacing shingles or laying down some new pitch and gravel on a rooftop, your contractor may be cutting into drywall or replacing sections of ceiling and roof. In some cases, you may have to go through a costly mold eradication project.Reminder: Unless the damage can be traced to a specific wind or weather event, chances are your home insurance company won’t pay for damages caused by a leaking roof. Insurance is there in case an act of God or vandalism forces you to replace your roof prematurely. Ensuring you replace your roof before natural and expected wear and tear causes a problem is your responsibility.To help avoid these needless expenses, replace your roofbeforeit leaks.How do you know when it’s time? Look for these signs. In addition, a roof that has been damaged due to wear and tear, which can no longer protect the home from water seeping in, may result in a claim that is not covered by home insurance. The reason for this is that damage generally needs to be sudden and accidental in order to be covered by home insurance. Also, home insurance policies are generally not intended to cover claims that could be prevented, including those caused by poor maintenance of a home. If home insurance companies were to provide coverage for these types of claims, it would likely result in higher home insurance rates to make up for the irresponsible homeowners.

Gretchen Whitmer has signed into law a bill making it illegal to hold and use a mobile electronic device while operating a motor vehicle in Michigan. With the bill signing, Michigan becomes the 26th state in the U.S. to establish hands-free driving laws. How Did We Get Here? In early May, the Michigan House and Senate passed House Bills 4250, 4251, and 4252 to amend parts of the Michigan Vehicle Code in an effort to reduce distracted-driving crashes and fatalities.Texting while driving is already illegal in Michigan, but that law was instituted years ago, when cell phones and their capabilities were much different. The new law now makes all cell phone usage illegal while driving. What’s in the New Law? The bill amends Michigan law to make it illegal to “use a mobile electronic device to do any task, including, but not limited to” the following: The law makes holding or using a cell phone while driving a primary offense – meaning an officer could pull someone over and ticket them for this offense. The new legislation specifically states, however, that police would not be allowed to search a driver solely because of this violation.The legislation defines holding a cell phone or electronic device as physically supporting it with “any part of the hands, arms or shoulders.” Potential Fines Drivers caught violating the rules would face fines and/or be required to perform community service.If a person is caught holding or using a cell phone, or mobile electronic device, while driving a regular motor vehicle, they would face the following fines: If a person driving a commercial vehicle or a school bus is caught holding or using a cell phone, they would face the following fines: Under the legislation, if a crash were to occur and the at-fault driver was holding or using a cell phone while driving, any civil fines would be doubled. Law Exceptions There are a few exceptions to the rules. What Is Distracted Driving? Driver inattention is the leading factor in most crashes and near-crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Virginia Tech Transportation Institute.Driving is a visual task and non-driving activities that draw the driver’s eyes away from the roadway should always be avoided.As of July 1, 2010, Michigan law prohibits texting while driving. For a first offense, motorists are fined $100. Subsequent offenses cost $200.There are three main types of distraction: Texting is the most alarming distraction because it involves all three types of distraction.Distracting activities include: How not to be distracted:  Source: Michigan State Police This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

The standard formulas for buying coverage to match a specific percentage of income are often inadequate and fail to take individual circumstances into account.Online calculation tools usually tell everyone to raise their coverage by $1 million. But life insurance is a personal issue.For example, a married couple with three children and a mortgage will need more coverage than a childless couple without a mortgage.When the markets are down, many people are tempted to shirk their life insurance needs. Major life changes also affect how people deal with their individual needs. It is best to take a systematic approach to buying coverage instead of relying on standard rules and formulas. One Simple Strategy The main purpose of life insurance is to provide survivors with enough funds to pay the final expenses and continue life comfortably.This is why most calculators are programmed to suggest a chunk of money equal to at least 20 years of regular income. With overall longer life expectancy and a lower savings yield, this may be too high of a goal for most people.There is a much simpler strategy for figuring out exactly how much insurance you need. It is also better to buy from a plan that is easy to update.After projecting personal needs from the following four categories, assess the situation to see if extra coverage or different policies are needed.Debts and mortgages:Write down the total of all auto loans, mortgages, student loans and any other debts. All of these debts may be a serious burden for survivors to handle. However, survivors may choose to keep up mortgage payments. Be sure to allow enough money that this will be possible.Final expenses:Traditional funerals may cost between $10,000 and $20,000.While pre-planning a funeral is beneficial, it is even more important to ensure enough life insurance funds are available to pay the final bill. For a reasonable funeral figure, aim for $15,000.Income replacement:Families will not need 100% of the policyholder's current income. Be sure to deduct final expenses, education costs and debts.As a rule, it is best to plan on replacing 50% of pretax income until retirement. This amount can be placed in a lump sum by dividing 50% of annual income by 0.05.Education expenses:Tuition costs vary school by school, and they may be much different by the time children are ready to enroll in college.The average cost of college tuition has been rising by about 5% each year. This is the same rate life insurance is expected to grow over time. Calculate the future cost of tuition at the desired colleges. The Final Calculation To determine how much life insurance is needed, add all four of the above categories' totals.If there is no pension, it is beneficial to increase the amount. However, if a spouse earns a considerable salary, it may be feasible to decrease the total.For family members with unique or troublesome medical conditions, add between $100,000 and $250,000. The overall total usually adds up to a six-figure amount or slightly over $1 million. Other Considerations Increasing a death benefit on a term life insurance policy usually costs several hundred dollars each year, so the premium amount should not be impossible to pay. To get a better idea of what to expect for a premium, discuss the figures with an agent.Getting married, having children, buying property and retiring are all life steps that require more life insurance.There are many different options for this coverage. Young and healthy individuals can usually lock in a low price for many years. Some policies also come with the option to convert to permanent coverage, which can be kept regardless of future health conditions.Term life becomes expensive after age 65, so it is a smart idea to consider whole or universal policies. To determine the best option, speak with an agent.ALAN-27162-820-XX Related Articles Avoid These 20 Passwords That Are Easily Hacked Safeguard Your Wedding Ring with the Right Insurance Will Your Insurance Cover You While Moving?

These, too, are susceptible to disasters.  However, with careful planning and foresight, you can protect both your home and your valuable financial information from being lost or destroyed.It is imperative that you have backups for all of your important paperwork, such as marriage certificates, birth certificates, death certificates, social security cards, passports, drivers license, medical records, credit card numbers, bank account information, deeds, mortgages, car titles, tax returns, insurance policies and contact numbers, wills, power of attorney and contact information for executors, trustees and guardians.  It is also important to maintain a household inventory of valuable items. Photographs of these belongings, recent appraisals and receipts for more expensive items are documents that should all be protected. Compile an itemized list of these items, including a brief description as well as serial numbers, cost, age and manufacturer.How can you store this information safely, without the copies, too, being destroyed in a disaster? There are several options for backup storage. A fireproof safe in the home is an option for maintaining the originals, but if the home is completely destroyed, recovering the safe may not be possible. Mailing copies to a relative in a different geographic location may be the best alternative. You could also send copies to a financial adviser in another part of the country.Another option is e-mailing scanned copies of the documents to yourself, so that you will be able to access them from any location with an Internet connection. Unfortunately, if your email is not secure, you will be exposing yourself to a perfect opportunity for identity theft. A few websites are now offering web-based backup services that can, for a small yearly fee, store your documents safely. Such services will also allow you, or anyone you trust with your account information, to access the information from anywhere.The importance of sending copies so far away is because natural disasters typically affect an entire region.  If all your backups and originals are stored in the same area, all will be lost. In this respect, it is also important to have backup plans for your trusted advisors: any executors, trustees, advisors or guardians. If these individuals are all located in your region, they, too, may be affected by the natural disaster. It is a good idea to have these individuals spread out across the country, or to designate backups to act in place of these individuals, in case of a local disaster.

Regardless of the magnitude of the upgrade, you can minimize your risk of financial loss by making sure the right insurance is in place before and after the work takes place.It's easy to hope nothing is going to happen, but an incident is much more likely to occur during construction. Failing to address this possibility beforehand can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. Before the remodel The most important thing you want to do before you agree to hire a contractor is to make sure the company has a contractor's liability insurance policy in place. The minimum amount of coverage your contractor should have is $1 million.If the contractor has workers, then you should ask for a worker's compensation policy, as well. In some cases, the contractor will state that the workers are subcontractors and therefore not true employees, so they don't need worker's compensation insurance.However, the legal system may very well view these \"subcontractors\" as employees. As such, this can put you at risk should an injury occur to any of these workers.Here are the characteristics of true subcontractors: If most of these characteristics are not present, then there is a good chance the legal system can deem them as an employee of the general contractor. Again, this can put you at risk if the contractor does not carry any worker's comp insurance.It's worth paying more to hire the right contractor than have to deal with a contractor that doesn't have the right insurance in place.A contractor without appropriate insurance rarely wants to admit this. This is why it's important to ask for a certificate of insurance for these policies directly from the contractor's agent.Make sure the dates are current or will at least offer coverage throughout the duration of your remodel job. If the policy is going to expire in the middle of the project, be sure to get an updated certificate.In addition, you may want to secure a builder's risk policy for the uninstalled material that is stored on the premises. Depending on your remodel situation, this may or may not be covered by your homeowner's insurance.Check with your agent or insurer before you plan on having raw materials stored on your property. It's also best to discuss any other insurance issues with your agent. After construction Once construction is complete, you should review your homeowner's policy coverage with us. The top priority is to make sure your home is fully insured according to the new rebuilding value.If you have done an interior remodel, such as a new kitchen/bathroom or finishing the basement, and not an expansion, you have likely increased the cost per square footage.If you have undertaken an expansion, then you need to account for your additional square footage. We will do an updated replacement cost estimate, which will take into account the characteristics of your rebuilt home.Some other important considerations: This is extremely important, since you have invested tens of thousands of dollars upgrading your home. You need to update your coverage to protect that investment.  This blog post provides general information only. Discounts and savings opportunities subject to eligibility requirements.

From overloaded outlets to dated or defective wiring, there’s likely to be at least one electrical fire hazard in some corner of your home. The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that faulty electrical wiring in residential homes cause more than 40,000 fires each year. Over the last decade, defective electrical wiring has caused an average of 350 deaths per year. According to the National Electrical Safety Foundation, homeowners can use the following fire prevention tips to help create a fire-proof home electrical system: The following suggestions should be performed by a licensed electrician: Of course, despite all precautions, you still need to know what to do should an electrical fire start. For an electrical fire at a wall outlet, you can either turn off the main switch, or if you can do it safely, immediately try to pull anything that’s plugged into the outlet out by pulling on the end of the cord furthest away from the outlet. CO2 fire extinguishers can be used for small electrical fires, but do remember never to use water on an electrical fire. In the event the electrical fire is large or otherwise uncontrolled, then you should evacuate the home and immediately alert the fire department that you have an electrical fire. It’s important that you tell the fire department if you suspect the fire could be electrical since they may be able to shut off the main power source and prevent it from spreading.

After all, they get to dress up as spooky creatures or their favorite characters from TV shows or movies, and to collect bags of candy. But every year, hundreds of kids get hurt, sick or worse on the evening of Oct. 31, and there is nothing worse than ending up in the emergency room with your child when they should be out having fun.Fortunately, there are steps you can take to help reduce the chances of having your children’s Halloween spoiled by something unpleasant. Here are some tips: Safe Pumpkin Carving Expecting Company? Any homeowners planning a party for guests or expecting trick-or-treaters must take steps to ensure their guests stay safe and healthy. It is best to serve healthy snacks whenever possible. For home parties, provide fresh fruits, vegetables, cheeses and low-calorie snacks. Since sodium and sugar can be harmful for many guests, make sure any packaged snacks are low in both ingredients. For trick-or-treaters, buy healthy snacks that come in factory packaging.When planning games for a kids’ party, pick games that require physical exercise. To keep kids’ attention, plan several games to ensure they reach their daily dose of 60 minutes of exercise. Although it is best to use flameless candles and luminaries, keep any decorations with open flames out of the reach of children and out of areas where they could be hazards. Do not leave them unattended.As party guests leave, remind them to watch the streets carefully to avoid hitting any trick-or-treaters. For adult-only parties, do not let guests drive home if they have been drinking. Call a cab for them, allow them to sleep over or ask another sober driver to take any intoxicated guests home. Check twice for any hazards on the property to avoid lawsuits and increases in homeowners insurance premiums.More tips: Related Articles Avoid these 20 passwords that are easily hacked Safeguard your wedding ring with the right insurance Will your insurance cover you while moving Do you need comprehensive auto coverage  Meemic Insurance Company provides insurance for teachers and educators in Michigan.

Even so, students need to be careful when entering the “school bus danger zone” – 10 feet in front, behind or on either side of the bus. In addition, motorists need to be alert and always stop for a school bus when flashing lights are illuminated. According to NHTSA data, from 2006-2015 (the latest data available), 44 school-aged children and teens between the ages of 5-19 were killed in school zones traveling to or from school.* Out of that number, 77 percent (34) were pedestrians either struck by a school bus or another vehicle.In addition, the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services’ 2019 Stop Arm survey showed that 130,963 school bus drivers reported that 95,319 vehicles passed their buses illegally on a single day. Throughout a 180-day school year, these sample results point to more than 17 million violations among America’s driving public. NHTSA provides the following safety tips: For children Stand at least 6 feet (three giant steps) from the approaching school bus while waiting at the bus stop.When the school bus arrives, wait until the bus comes to a complete stop, the door opens, and the driver says it’s okay to get on or off. Use the handrails to avoid falling.Never walk behind a school bus. If you must cross the street in front of the bus, walk on a sidewalk or along the side of the street to a place at least 10 feet (five giant steps) in front of the bus before crossing. Make eye contact with the bus driver before crossing to make sure the driver can see that you’re crossing to avoid the danger zone. If you drop something near the school bus, like a phone or book, the safest thing is to tell the bus driver right away. You should not try to pick up the item, because the driver might not be able to see you.Always watch for oncoming traffic when approaching or leaving the bus. For motorists When driving in neighborhoods with bus stops, schools and school zones, watch out for children walking or bicycling to school.Slow down. Look for children walking in the street, especially if there are no sidewalks in the neighborhood.Remember, children do not easily estimate vehicle speeds and often misjudge when it is safe to cross the street when a vehicle is approaching. Learn and obey the school bus laws in your state. Obey the \"flashing signal light system\" that school bus drivers use to alert motorists of pending actions:  *NHTSA school zone data was based on child and teen deaths that occurred between the hours of 6-8:59 a.m. and 2-4:59 p.m. This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

While safe driving plays a critical role, many modern vehicles come equipped with advanced safety features designed to enhance winter driving. These innovations can contribute to a safer and more comfortable driving experience in cold and snowy conditions. Heated Mirrors One of the key safety features that can significantly improve visibility in winter weather is heated mirrors.Icy build-up on side mirrors can obstruct a driver's view, making lane changes and parking difficult. Heated mirrors melt away frost and ice, ensuring a clear line of sight and reducing the risk of accidents caused by impaired visibility. Anti-Slip Technology Anti-slip or traction control systems are crucial in preventing skids and maintaining control on slippery surfaces, including icy roads.These systems monitor wheel speed and apply selective braking to individual wheels when slippage is detected. This technology helps drivers maintain stability and control during acceleration and deceleration, reducing the likelihood of skidding on icy roads. Engine Block Heater In extremely cold climates, engine block heaters are invaluable for ensuring a smooth start in the morning. These heaters warm the engine and coolant, making it easier for the vehicle to turn over, reducing wear on the engine components, and minimizing the strain on the battery.A warm engine is not only more reliable but also operates more efficiently, enhancing overall vehicle performance in winter conditions. All-Wheel or Four-Wheel Drive Vehicles equipped with AWD or 4WD systems provide enhanced traction and control on slippery surfaces.These drivetrain configurations distribute power to all four wheels, improving stability and maneuverability in snow and ice. While these systems do not replace cautious driving, they provide an extra layer of safety in challenging winter conditions. Anti-Lock Braking System ABS is a standard safety feature that plays a crucial role in winter driving. The system prevents wheel lock-up during hard braking, allowing the driver to maintain steering control even on icy or snow-covered roads.By preventing skidding, ABS contributes to safer and more predictable stops, reducing the risk of collisions in winter conditions. Seat Warmers While not an essential safety feature, seat warmers serve a practical purpose beyond comfort in winter.Cold temperatures can impair muscle function and slow reaction times, increasing the risk of accidents. Heated seats keep drivers and passengers warm, promoting alertness and reducing the impact of cold weather on motor skills, contributing to safer driving conditions. Remote Start Also, more of a luxury than a necessity, the ability to start your car remotely lets you get the vehicle warmed up before you and your family hop inside of it. That will save you from the misery of having to sit down in a freezing car with frigid seats. The takeaway As winter weather brings its own set of challenges to the roads, modern vehicles are equipped with an array of safety features to mitigate these risks.While technology can enhance safety, it is essential for drivers to also practice caution, adjust their driving habits and be prepared for the unique challenges that winter conditions present.By combining advanced safety features with responsible driving, you can confidently navigate winter roads with reduced risks and increased peace of mind.

The other driver gets out his car and appears unhurt. He inspects the bumper and says, “Let’s just forget about it.”You agree and go on your merry way.A few weeks later, however, your insurance company informs you that the man is suing you for lost wages, neck injuries, and pain and suffering.Where did you go wrong? The so-called accident was only a tiny tap that barely scratched paint. There couldn’t have been an injury, as your terrified daughter tells your insurance company’s attorney.There are things you could have done to avoid this mess. Fender-benders — or even smaller collisions — don’t have to spiral out of control like this if you take the appropriate precautions and steps.Your first thought might be to call the police. But in some jurisdictions, the police will not respond unless there are injuries. It’s best to call and let the local police department advise. You can file a report later.Then, by taking the steps below you can help protect yourself from false claims and help Meemic reach the best decisions: 1. Have all your documents That means always carrying your driver’s license, registration and insurance information. Be sure it is with all family drivers at all times. 2. Take Pictures Use your smartphone to take pictures of the vehicles from many angles that show the street, any traffic lights and where the cars are positioned.Also, take pictures of all the occupants of the other car, preferably while they are still in the vehicle — or at least while they are all still at the scene.This can also thwart a fraud scheme called “jump ins.” In an attempt to get a bigger settlement, people known to the claimant come forward and say they were also in the car and also suffered injuries.Take pictures of the site of the accident. Having photos of the cars on location can help you make your own case to the claims adjuster.Write down the specifics of the location as well, for example: “The southwest corner of Bank and Broad streets, about three car lengths before the mailbox.” 3. Get witnesses’ information If there are witnesses, get their names and addresses. Some may be reluctant; be persistent within reason. 4. Exchange information Exchange information with the other driver. This information includes: If the driver is not the person named on the insurance card, find out and write down what the relationship is between the driver and that person; family, friend or employee. Write down the policyholder’s name, address and phone information, as well.Finally, write down a complete description of the other car, including year, make, model and color.

And SUVs have a considerably higher risk of rollovers due to their higher center of gravity, and they can be more difficult to handle than a sedan.They need much more braking distance between themselves and the car in front of them due to their weight. They can also cause significantly more damage when they crash, increasing the risk to third parties in accidents.They also are much more prone to slip, skid or flip in hazardous road conditions. Tips for Safer SUVing Considering all the above, it’s crucial that you exercise extra caution and avoid distractions when driving an SUV. You should heed the following advice:Slow down.Driving too fast is dangerous; driving too fast in an SUV is even more so. The longer you have to react, the less likely you are to cause or be involved in an accident.Avoid sudden or sharp steering.An SUV is not designed to make fast, sharp turns as a smaller, lower car can. Give yourself more time to react and make smoother steering transitions.Allow more distance from the vehicle in front of you.You need more time to brake in a larger vehicle. It’s imperative therefore that you not only drive slower than you would in a smaller vehicle, but that you also leave more space between you and the car in front of you (that means more than the three-second rule).Check tires regularly.Checking your tires regularly is one of the easiest things you can do to help prevent rollovers and other auto accidents.Tires that are in good condition will have more traction and help ensure you have control over the vehicle even when conditions are not ideal. If you notice your tires are worn down or damaged, replace them as soon as possible.Avoid overloading your SUV.The more weight you add to the vehicle, the more top-heavy it becomes, increasing the risk of rollover if there is an accident. When a vehicle’s load is poorly balanced, the likelihood of a rollover in a top-heavy SUV rises.Load your SUV evenly on both sides, front to back to even out the higher center of gravity that makes an SUV prone to tipping. Dispersing the weight will help even out the vehicle’s stability. This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

Besides the avoidable deaths of the animals, these fires can often burn down an entire home or barn, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more) in damage.In May 2023, a fire that caused nearly $225,000 worth of damage to a two-story farmhouse in Matteson Township, MI, was attributed to a heating lamp that caught fire.In April 2023, a duck coop in a Santa Rosa, CA, backyard caught fire after a heat lamp sparked combustible materials. The fire spread to a nearby home, causing $270,000 in damage. That same month in Santa Rosa, a heat lamp ignited straw in a garage, killing a number of chicks and a lamb.In February 2021, a dog being warmed outdoors by a heat lamp in Houma, LA, died in a fire that broke out when the lamp overheated. That same month, a fire caused by an overheated heat lamp in a barn in neighboring Bossier Parish killed seven horses.The above cases illustrate the importance of not leaving heating lamps unattended and keeping them away from flammable materials like bedding and hay.If you are using heating lamps, farm safety experts recommend: The best option is to avoid a heat lamp altogether. Off the Grid News recommends: The takeaway If an animal bumps into a heat lamp or chews on the cord, a fire can easily ensue. If you use heat lamps to keep your pets or livestock warm, you have to make sure that you check them multiple times a day. This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

But, we now have sophisticated alarms and multiple cameras that you can monitor with your smartphone, as well as other devices that are not too expensive and that can give you peace of mind.Meemic may also give you a discount on your homeowner’s insurance for installing some of these devices.If you want to make your home more secure and smarter, you may want to consider these new technologies:Smart doorbell: Smart doorbells come equipped with an HD camera that can film anybody that comes to your door; they don’t have to ring the doorbell. If they do, the device allows you to see who is arriving at your home regardless of where you are in the world, and to communicate via two-way audio with visitors.This is a great way to also catch video of any thieves stealing packages from your doorstep.Smart locks: There are two types of smart locks: Smart lights: With smart lights, you can control every bulb in your home from an app - whether or not you’re nearby. It’s perfect for when you have left home and suddenly realize you left your bedroom light on. You can also remotely turn lights on at night if you are not home, to give the appearance that someone is home.Smart detector: Smart detectors come with the same smoke sensors and carbon monoxide detectors as any other regular alarm. They will alert you through a smartphone app that there is smoke or carbon monoxide in the air. A smart detector will tell you whether it’s smoke or gas - and where it’s coming from.Smart surveillance: If you have children or pets, you may have thought about using home video cameras to keep an eye on them. And while it’s wonderful to have a live feed you can watch remotely, that’s not all it can be used for.With smart surveillance cameras, you’ll also be notified if an intruder is in your home. Sensors will detect a break-in through glass doors or windows, then show you where that person is, so you can alert the local authorities.For more information, visitMeemic.com/Safetyortalk to an agenttoday!

The crews do that by providing a safe route for motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists and a safe area for the workers on the scene.That stew of activity and unpredictability sadly results in fatal accidents.

Unfortunately, every year, more than 11,000 people are sent to the emergency room for fireworks-related injuries, and in a typical year, about eight to 10 people are killed by fireworks, according to the National Fire Protection Association. On top of that, fourth of July fireworks start an average of 18,500 fires every year, including 1,300 structure fires, 300 vehicle fires and 16,900 outside fires, the NFPA says. But you can take steps to help protect your family and your property so that you don’t have to be one of those statistics. It all comes down to common sense and respecting the power of the fireworks. Mind the sparklers:Usually, these are known as “kiddie” fireworks, but you may be surprised to know that they cause a quarter of house fires on the Fourth of July. Sparklers are best handled by people aged 12 and older. Children younger than 12 require extreme supervision. Everyone handling sparklers should wear closed-toe shoes, and not flip-flops or sandals, to help protect their feet from sparks. Adult supervision:Always have an adult supervise fireworks activities, and never allow children to play with or ignite fireworks. Sparklers alone account for one-quarter of emergency room fireworks injuries. Keep a safe distance from your home:If you are going to use fireworks at home, be sure you’re lighting them in a safe area. A safe area means away from homes and buildings. Look out for tree limbs or bushes that could catch fire. If your gutters have accumulated leaves, pine needles or other flammable material, clean them before using fireworks near your home. If you’re leaving town for the holiday, ask a neighbor to keep an eye on your house. Be prepared for the worst:If you set off fireworks, keep a bucket of water handy in case of malfunction or fire. A fire extinguisher should be kept nearby in case of an emergency, especially if you are lighting fireworks on your street. Follow instructions:Always follow instructions for lighting fireworks. If fireworks malfunction, don’t relight them! Douse and soak them with water, then throw them away. Also, never ignite fireworks in a container, especially one that is glass or metal. Stay away from others:Don’t aim fireworks at other people. They can cause severe injury. Two Words About M-class Fireworks Just don’t.You hear them go off every year: M-80s, M-100s, even M-250s. The unmistakable explosions associated with these devices can rattle the windows of homes for blocks. They are produced illegally and without quality control, have short fuses and cause hundreds of extremely severe injuries each year.The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosivesoutlines the risks of these explosive devices.

If someone pitches up offering to step in and handle repairs and your insurance, you should not take them up on their offer. Call Us First After a storm, you should immediately call your home insurance company to file your claim and arrange for repairs. Or if you find your own contractor, make sure to do your research and verify credentials before signing any contracts or agreeing to any services.The worst you can do is to agree to repairs without first consulting your home insurance company, as these scammers will often try to get you to pay for some of the work up-front and tell you they’ll cover your insurance deductible. Don’t believe them.Your home insurance company can refer you to contractors who can get the job done. Using a referred contractor can give you peace of mind, as your home insurance company can screen the contractor for you.When you choose a referred contractor, it can help protect you from scams, and you are always free to get second opinions and negotiate with your adjuster. If you choose to get your own contractor, you should look for some basic things to help decide whether they are reputable and can do the job. Dos and Don’ts To help avoid getting duped and fleeced, you can follow this advice from the Texas Department of Insurance: Finally, be aware of anyone claiming to be from a charitable organization and offering to help following a storm, as there are fake operators at large here, too. Don’t take what they say at face value and be sure to carefully check out their credentials before accepting any offer of assistance.

In celebration of Independence Day, we’re highlighting signatories who were educators or who were influential to education: Benjamin Franklin (Pennsylvania) Benjamin Franklin was a leading figure in American history. Throughout his life, he was a statesman, author, publisher, scientist, inventor and diplomat. While he did not teach, Benjamin Franklin was an influential figure in education. In 1731, in response to the lack of books available in the colonies, Franklin established a lending library. It was the largest public library in the United States until the 1850s. Additionally, Franklin was heavily involved with the creation of the University of Philadelphia. Known as the Academy of Philadelphia until 1791, the college’s doors opened in 1751. Thomas Jefferson (Virginia) Thomas Jefferson was best known as the author of the Declaration of Independence, as well as being the third president of the United States. Jefferson also founded the University of Virginia. He was so proud of this accomplishment that he listed it as one of three in the epitaph that he wrote for himself. The other two accomplishments were being the author of the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Benjamin Rush (Pennsylvania) Benjamin Rush was a professor of chemistry at the College of Philadelphia and a professor of medical theory and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania. He was very influential in medicine. He is known for publishing the first American textbook on chemistry. John Witherspoon (New Jersey) John Witherspoon was the first president of the College of New Jersey. He worked very hard and turned it into a successful institution. Today, it is called Princeton University. Lewis Morris (New York) Lewis Morris was on the First Board of Regents of the University of New York. He served on it until his death in 1798. George Wythe (Virginia) George Wythe was the nation’s first law professor. He taught Thomas Jefferson, Henry Clay, James Monroe, John Marshal and other distinguished officials. Wythe taught for 20 years. He loved that he was able to shape young minds. George Clymer (Pennsylvania) George Clymer was the first president of the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts. He held this post until he passed in January of 1813. James Wilson (Pennsylvania) James Wilson was a Latin tutor, an English literature lecturer and the first law professor at the College of Philadelphia.

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/why-meemic/blog/claims-safety/protecting-your-home-against-garage-fires: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Share This Article: Protecting Your Home Against Garage Fires After the kitchen, the garage is the second-most common place in the home where fires start.There are some 6,600 garage fires that cause an estimated $457 million in property losses every year, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.The danger is that these fires, after they start, are rarely confined to the garage, easily spreading into adjacent parts of the house and beyond.One reason garages are especially prone to fires is that many homeowners store chemicals and flammable liquids, boxes with personal effects, clothes and other flammable materials in them. What You Can Do Don’t overload outlets:Electrical problems are the top cause of garage fires. If you are using electrical strips and plugging multiple items into your outlets, you could be creating a fire hazard.Plug only one appliance into each outlet and inspect all cords to ensure they are not frayed, broken or bent. Do not keep items you are not using plugged in for extended periods of time, particularly chargers for drill batteries. They have been known to catch fire.Don’t store flammable materials:There are a number of flammable materials you should avoid storing in the garage as they can easily catch fire if there is a spark nearby.Materials you should not keep in your garage include: Instead of the garage, store flammable liquids and fertilizer in a shed that is not attached to your home.If you are keeping other flammable materials in your garage, like newspapers, books, magazines, old files, clothing and more, keep them in sealed boxes and not loose in the open.Install a proper door:The door between the home and the garage should be solid-core with a minimum 20-minute fire rating and a self-closing mechanism.Maintain your car:If you notice liquid stains underneath your vehicle, have the problem checked by your mechanic and repaired if necessary.Cracked fuel lines, broken fuel injectors and a malfunctioning car battery could all cause a fire, as well.Declutter your garage:If you have a cluttered garage, it is at higher risk of fire and having a fire spread quickly. Declutter your garage by throwing away stuff you don’t need and making it tidy.Install a heat alarm:Smoke detectors aren’t used in the garage because cars produce smoke and carbon monoxide — two things that set off a smoke detector. Instead, consider a heat alarm, which will only trigger if there is a dramatic increase in temperature.Fire extinguisher:Make sure you have a fire extinguisher in your garage that can put out flammable liquid and electrical fires, the most common fires in garages. Ideally, that would be the B:C fire extinguisher.Protect the water heater:Keep a 3-foot radius clear around the water heater. If a flammable item comes in contact with it for an extended period of time, it can easily catch fire. The Takeaway Taking steps to fire-proof your garage can give you peace of mind and prevent a calamity that could burn your home to the ground. Fires fueled by flammable liquids and clutter can spread quickly, leaving you little time to act.Don’t let that happen in your home.

Lots can go wrong, like theft of an item or damage to their belongings.Now is a good time to take stock of your insurance and what kind of coverage is available to college students. On- or off-campus living You’ll be happy to know that you may be able to extend your homeowner’s policy to cover them and their stuff when they are away at school, especially while living in a dorm on campus.If your child lives off campus and not in a dorm, your homeowner’s policy will not fully cover them. The rules change depending on where they live, and if they are in an apartment or house, they may need a separate renter’s policy.So if your child lives in a dorm the first year and then moves into a rental with friends, you should seriously consider getting a renter’s policy for them. Vehicle If your child is taking a car with them, the insurance you need will depend on whether the vehicle is in your name or theirs.The cost of coverage for the vehicle will change depending on where your child is staying and where the car is kept. If they are going out of state, you will need to inform us.On the other hand, if your child isn’t bringing a car, you should consider keeping them on your policy.

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/why-meemic/blog/claims-safety/windshield-repair-or-replace: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Share This Article: Windshield: Repair or Replace? So your windshield got hit by a rock and now it's developed a chip or – even worse – a crack. Even if it's just a chip now, it could soon spread, eventually spanning the entire length of your windshield. So what do you do? Is it time for a full replacement, or should you consider fixing your windshield? Autotrader shares some advice. Fixing Your Windshield: The Basics In years past, getting a chip in your windshield meant silently hoping that the chip didn't turn into a crack, which would require full windshield replacement – at a high cost. Often, it was only a matter of time before the chip spread, no matter how careful you were or how much you crossed your fingers that you wouldn't need to replace your windshield. But that's no longer the case. Modern technology has come a long way, and that includes the realm of windshield repair, as most chips can now be filled and repaired to the point where you wouldn't be able to tell that they ever existed in the first place. Of course, there are limitations. Most windshield repair businesses say that a chip larger than a nickel (or a crack larger than 3 inches in length) is no longer repairable, and will require the full replacement of the windshield. It's also worth noting that chips in the middle of the windshield are a lot less concerning than chips on the side, which are more likely to spread quickly. Also be aware that some facilities may not repair a chip that appears directly in the driver's line of vision. Because the repair process leaves minor distortions in the glass, some shops prefer to replace the windshield rather than compromise the driver's vision. Still, if you spot a chip on your windshield, we suggest bringing your vehicle to a well-reviewed windshield repairer in your area before it turns into a costly crack. The Costs: Repair and Replacement Exactly how much will it cost to repair – or replace – your windshield? A full windshield replacement can be expensive, with the service costing around $500 for many typical compact and midsize cars, and $1,000 or more for certain luxury models, especially if your vehicle features a heated windshield. As usual, independent shops tend to charge less than dealerships, as dealers use more expensive automaker parts. By comparison, replacing a windshield chip is very cheap. Most windshield repair firms charge less than $100 per chip, with some charging closer to $50 or $60 – a huge discount compared to replacing your vehicle's entire windshield. Better yet, if you have comprehensive insurance, you might be able to get your windshield repaired for free. Many insurance companies would rather repair a chip than pay to replace a windshield – so they're often willing to waive your deductible and pay for your entire repair if you find a chip in your windshield. If your chip is already too far-gone to repair, your comprehensive insurance policy will cover a new windshield, but you'll have to pay your deductible. Our take: If you spot a chip in your windshield, get it fixed before it comes a serious crack, which will be more expensive to you and your insurer. How Does Windshield Repair Work? Windshield repair involves injection of a special resin into the damaged area using a tool that attaches directly to the glass. Once injected, this resin is then cured and polished to restore the clarity and strength to the glass. When a chip or crack occurs, it often spreads into the windshield's inner layer of plastic, which is sandwiched between two layers of glass. In some instances, a drill is used to make a clean passageway to the plastic, where the resin is injected to repair the damage. Think of a windshield repair as first-aid that prevents the damage from getting worse. In some cases, it may look nearly perfect, while in others, it could still appear slightly blemished. But in either case, a proper repair prevents damage from spreading. And since every chip is unique, some will respond more effectively to repair than others. A repaired windshield will never look as perfectly clear as a brand new one. Getting the Work Done When it comes to repairing or replacing your windshield, you have a number of possible options. It all depends on your specific needs. Source:Autotrader Related Articles Do Roundabouts Make You Nervous?

Here’s a handy FAQ on thunderstorms and tornadoes, with information on watches and warnings, and how to get weather information.1. What is a severe thunderstorm?A severe thunderstorm produces large hail that is one inch in diameter or larger, damaging winds of 58 mph or greater, and/or a tornado.2. What is a tornado?A tornado is a column of violently rotating winds extending down from a thunderstorm cloud and touching the surface of the earth.3. What is the difference between a tornado and a funnel cloud?A funnel cloud is also a column of violently rotating winds extending down from a thunderstorm; however, it does not touch the earth as a tornado does. 4. When do tornadoes generally occur?Most tornadoes occur during the months of May, June, July and August primarily in the late afternoon and evening hours. However, tornadoes can occur any time of the day or night in almost any month during the year.5. How fast do tornadoes travel?Tornadoes generally travel from the southwest at an average speed of 30 mph. However, some tornadoes have very erratic paths, with speeds approaching 70 mph.6. How far do tornadoes travel once they touch the ground?Many tornadoes are on the ground for less than 10 minutes and travel a distance of about five miles. However, they do not always follow the norm and have been known to stay on the ground for more than an hour and travel more than 100 miles.7. When is a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch issued?A tornado or severe thunderstorm watch is issued whenever conditions exist for severe weather to develop. Watches are usually for large areas and are usually two to six hours long. Watches give you time to plan and prepare.8. When is a tornado or severe thunderstorm warning issued?The local National Weather Service (NWS) office issues a tornado warning whenever NWS Doppler Radar indicates a thunderstorm is capable of producing a tornado or when a tornado has been sighted by a credible source. A severe thunderstorm warning is issued whenever a severe thunderstorm is observed or NWS Doppler Radar indicates a thunderstorm is capable of producing damaging winds or large hail.Warnings are issued for even smaller areas, such as parts of counties. These “storm-based” NWS warnings are issued for the threatened area in a shape of a polygon. The “polygon” warnings only include sections of a county or group of counties and usually last for 30 to 90 minutes in length. You must act immediately when you first hear the warning. If severe weather is near you, seek shelter immediately. If not, keep a constant lookout for severe weather and stay near a shelter.9. What is a special marine warning?The NWS will issue a special marine warning for the Great Lakes and the connecting waterways when a strong or severe thunderstorm develops or moves over the water. The special marine warning is issued for boaters, both recreational and commercial. For residents and visitors of coastal communities, the special marine warning provides valuable information about a storm that is about to move onshore.10. How do I find out about a warning if my electricity is already out?A NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards with battery back-up capability is your best source to receive the warning. In some areas, civil emergency sirens may be your first official warning. In addition, if your television or radio has battery back-up capability, you may receive NOAA’s National Weather Service warnings from local media.

While a swimming pool can provide lots of fun for your family and guests, and can increase the value of your home, it can also bring on higher homeowner’s insurance rates.Before you dive in and add a pool to your property or buy a home that already has one, here are three important things to keep in mind:1. You may need to increase your insurance coverage.A pool increases your exposure to risk. You could be on the line for medical bills and other damages if people get hurt in or around your pool, even if they weren’t invited over for a swim.At the same time, a pool increases the value of your property.Your homeowner’s insurance needs to reflect both the increased value and risk of a pool, and you may want the added protection of an umbrella policy.2. Safety measures may be required.Your town or municipality may require a fence and locked gate for your pool, and even have specific guidelines on the height of that fence. Meemic also has requirements regarding fencing and diving boards.If your house opens directly onto the pool area, you may also consider a door alarm and safety cover to keep pets, children and other non-swimmers safe.3. Pool equipment, furniture and accessories increase the value of your belongings.Make sure to include any pool- or patio-related items of value, especially bigger-ticket items such as electronics and outdoor kitchen equipment, when you add up how much your personal belongings are worth, and ensure you have enough coverage on your homeowner’s insurance policy.

It's important to understand what you can do to observe window safety, especially when young children are in the home. Why Is Window Safety Week Important? Window Safety Week coincides with the arrival of spring, when homeowners naturally want to open the windows and let in fresh air. Its goal is twofold: for families to understand the role of windows in escaping a fire or other emergency and to learn to safeguard against accidental window falls. The Window Safety Task Force of the National Safety Council proudly observes Window Safety Week each year during the first full week of April. Print theirwindow safety brochure; checklist and kids'activity book, and share them with everyone in your household so they are aware of their role in window safety. Our hope is that these lessons will last a lifetime. A Window Could Be Your Lifeline in an Emergency Windows have saved many lives when used as emergency escape routes. Larger, egress windows can take on an even greater role by preventing families from being trapped in a basement and by more easily allowing rescue crews to enter the home. How prepared are you to escape a fire? You will likely have little time to think, which is why it is essential to develop and test an escape plan at least twice a year with everyone in the home. As part of your home escape plan: Window Falls Are Preventable According toSafeKids.org: \"It only takes seconds for a preventable window fall to occur,\" said Amy Artuso, program manager at NSC. \"To avoid these needless tragedies, it is very important for parents and caregivers to take steps to prevent home falls.\" Do you ever think about your windows, other than how dirty they are getting? Take a few minutes now to consider what you can do to help keep your loved ones safe around windows, and commit these rules to memory: What Is the Window Safety Task Force? Formed in 1997, the Window Safety Task Force works year-round in conjunction with NSC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Safe Kids Worldwide, the International Code Council and other safety advocates to promote window safety awareness.

Increasingly, however, criminals are less interested in what’s inside the car than they are in what’s underneath it – the catalytic converter.The National Insurance Crime Bureau has reported that thefts of catalytic converters jumped by 325% in 2020 compared to 2019, the latest data available. Reported claims rose by more than 11,000 in 2020, and not all claims get reported.If the catalytic converter on your vehicle is stolen, it can cost you on average up to $2,000 to replace it, and it is illegal to drive your car without one. The resulting gap in your exhaust system also makes the car run poorly until it is fixed. Depending on what type of insurance you have, it may or may not cover the theft. Where’s the Attraction for Thieves? A vehicle’s catalytic converter takes in raw exhaust from the vehicle’s engine. It then converts the harmful chemicals in the exhaust to carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor. The process reduces harmful emissions into the air. Federal law has required vehicles to include catalytic converters since the 1975 model year.The devices contain a “honeycomb” structure that, when heated up, causes a chemical reaction that converts the harmful gasses to less dangerous ones. The honeycomb is made of three rare and expensive metals: platinum, palladium and rhodium.Catalytic converters are attracting thieves because of the prices fetched by these metals. An ounce of rhodium sells for more than $15,000, while palladium goes for more than $2,100 an ounce, and platinum is worth more than $1,000 an ounce. Online sellers of stolen catalytic converters can fetch up to $1,500; thieves net an average of $200 per unit.Theft of catalytic converters is also a low-risk crime. A thief who knows what he’s doing can remove one in just a couple of minutes. Manufacturers do not stamp serial numbers or other identifiers on them, so a stolen converter is very difficult to trace. The Cost to You In addition to the cost of purchasing and installing a new catalytic converter, the victim of a theft may have a long wait. Supply chain disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have meant that it can take weeks for a new unit to arrive.If the catalytic converter on your vehicle is stolen, your auto insurance may pay part of the cost of replacing it if you purchased comprehensive coverage. This insurance covers loss of or damage to the vehicle from causes other than collision.The policyholder is responsible for paying the deductible, however. In some cases, the deductible may be almost as much as the cost of replacing the converter. Call us to discuss submitting a claim.* Helping Protect Your Vehicle You should also report the theft to the police, even if it seems unlikely that you will recover the stolen unit.There arestepsyou can take to help avoid becoming a victim of this crime: Some states are considering legislation that would crack down on catalytic converter theft. But any newly enacted laws will take some time to have an effect. In the meantime, expect the trend of increasing thefts of catalytic converters to continue while precious metal prices remain high, and units can be sold with little consequence.Take the above measures to reduce your risk and be ready to report a theft to the police and us if it happens to you.

They practice until they get it right, and even if you can see the accident was staged, onlookers or witnesses may only catch a glimpse and think they see something they didn’t.Here are some of the most common staged accidents.The T-bone:In this staged accident, the scammer will wait for your car to proceed through an intersection and then floor it and T-bone your vehicle. When police arrive, the scammer’s helpers will claim you ran a red light or ran the stop sign.The wave:In this scenario, the scammer will see you are trying to switch lanes and they wave you ahead. But when you do switch lanes, they will accelerate and hit your car. Once police arrive to take the accident report, they’ll lie and say you switched lanes when it was not safe to do so, and they didn’t have time to brake.Dual-turn sideswipe:In this set-up, you have to be in a dual left-turn lane on the inside and if you are close to the lane marker, the other driver will veer into you and claim you came out of your lane and hit them.Stopping short:The scammer will slam on their brakes when your car is close behind so that you will crash into the rear of the vehicle.Swoop and stop:In this scenario, a car will suddenly pull in front of yours and stop. Another vehicle will simultaneously pull up alongside your car, preventing you from swerving to avoid an accident. Furthering the Scams These scammers and their “passengers” will often also claim injuries they didn’t incur. They may also be in cahoots with shady doctors and chiropractors, who will inflate their billings and order all types of medical services to that end.Others may go to legitimate doctors and claim back injuries, which are difficult to prove. They may also sue for damages.These car crash scams can leave you paying for damages you didn’t cause. They also take time. Even if Meemic covers the crash and the damage to your car, you will still be without your car for a time, and dealing with insurance paperwork and the repair shop.And the “accident” can lead to higher insurance premiums for you later. How to Avoid Accident Scams One of the best ways to avoid being the victim of a fake accident claim is by exercising caution while driving.Tailgating or failing to leave enough space between your vehicle and a vehicle ahead of you leaves you vulnerable to becoming the victim of a staged accident. All the driver ahead of you has to do is abruptly stop to cause you to crash into the rear of their vehicle.If you believe you are being targeted by someone staging an accident, do not leave the scene. Call the police and let the officers who respond handle taking a report of the accident.Keep a camera (if you don’t have a smartphone), pen and paper in the car so that you can take photos and notes at the scene.Take pics from every angle of the involved vehicles, with special focus on the damage. Also, capture on camera the license plate, as well as photos of the driver and all the passengers in the other vehicle.Take down the following information: Also, be sure to call the police if you suspect that you were in a staged accident. Whatever you do, don’t offer cash to the other driver to settle the damage.When you report the accident to Meemic, you should say if you suspect a scam.

In many cases, vacations can involve thousands of dollars and months of advanced planning, organizing and saving. So, if you’re wondering if you should get travel insurance, the answer is often yes. Like any other investment of this magnitude, it’s important to make sure you have adequate insurance to protect your nonrefundable trip costs should the trip be cancelled due to severe weather, natural disaster, injury, illness (including COVID-19) or some other unforeseen event that upsets your vacation plans. Certain nontraveling family member illnesses can also trigger coverage benefits Meemic has partnered with AAA and Allianz Global Assistance to offer you expertise, stability and peace of mind to make your travel plans. Travel insurance can be purchased as a packaged plan with a variety of benefits, including Trip Cancellation and Interruption, Travel Delay, Baggage and Baggage delay, Emergency Medical, Emergency Medical Transportation, 24/7 Travel Assistance and much more. Let Meemic and AAA help find an Allianz Travel insurance plan that fits your needs. 1. Trip Cancellation and Interruption Travel insurance typically protects you from financial losses should certain circumstances prevent you from taking the trip. Each plan includes a list of named occurrences that are covered for trip cancellation. Look to the specific plan to determine covered reasons, but most will include circumstances like jury duty, military duty, a covered tour operator or cruise line going out of business, personal or family illnesses, and the death of a family member. The plan may also reimburse you, under the Trip Interruption benefit, for any unused, nonrefundable portion of your vacation should you become seriously ill or injured once on the trip. Travel insurance costs vary based on the benefit levels, the nonrefundable trip cost and the age of the traveler. Depending on which plan you choose, cost can be as little as 4-5% of trip cost up to 10-12% of trip cost. An investment in travel insurance not only protects nonrefundable trip costs but also protects the traveler during the trip. Keep in mind that trip cancellation benefits aren’t the same as the cancellation wavier your tour operator or cruise line may offer you. While the waiver is relatively inexpensive, at around $50 to $150, it must be purchased when you book your vacation. These cancel-for-any-reason waivers usually result in a future travel credit if you cancel, while more traditional travel protection pays cash back when you cancel for a covered reason. The waivers are usually accompanied by multiple restrictions, such as not covering a cancellation occurring near the date of departure or once the trip has begun. It’s important to remember that a cancellation waiver offered by a cruise line or tour operator isn’t insurance and isn’t regulated by any agency, which means it might not be worth the paper it’s printed on if the business goes bankrupt or closes. 2. Emergency Medical Benefits Ask your health insurance carrier what type and degree of coverage you’ll have on a trip to a foreign country. If your health insurance policy doesn’t cover you at all or leaves you under-insured while visiting a foreign country, then you may want to consider a travel insurance plan that includes emergency medical and emergency medical transportation. These benefits, along with the 24/7 travel assistance, can ensure that you are well protected if you experience a crisis during your trip. The plan can provide benefits for medical transportation to a hospital capable of treating your illness or injury, hospital stays, and, should you be seriously ill or injured, transportation home. 3. Travel Delay Benefits With more frequent severe weather conditions, travel delays are becoming increasingly common and can create extra, unplanned travel expenses like meals and accommodations. With travel delay benefits, you can be reimbursed for additional expenses like these during a covered delay. If you choose, you can opt to receive a flat, $100 payment per insured traveler for your covered delay. And if your plan includes SmartBenefitsTM*, your payment can even be sent to you automatically for tracked delays when you provide your flight details ahead of your trip. 4. Baggage/Personal Effects Benefits Many travel insurance plans provide benefits should your personal belongings be damaged, lost or stolen during a covered trip. This protection is limited to the max benefit, typically ranging between $500 and $2,000 per person, depending on the plan.Baggage delay benefits can also reimburse you for the purchase of essential replacement items after a covered baggage delay.You'll also want to determine if your homeowners or renters insurance covers off-premise thefts of high value items. Items not covered by your travel insurance policy could possibly be protected under your homeowners or renters policy. 5. 24/7 Live Assistance Benefits If you have a travel emergency or mishap, help is just a phone call away with round-the-clock assistance services wherever you’re traveling. These services include, but aren’t limited to, medical triage with referrals to local, prescreened medical providers and ongoing medical monitoring, payment guarantees, emergency medical transport arrangements, help making alternate transportation arrangements after missed flights, making accommodation arrangements for a quarantine and more. 6. Rental Car Damage Protection A typical auto insurance policy only covers your vehicle within U.S. states and territories and Canada. You can check with your auto insurance carrier to determine how your auto insurance will apply to your vacation destination and mode of transportation – rental or personal vehicle. Should your trip include renting a vehicle outside the areas specified in your personal auto insurance policy, then you’ll need to purchase coverage applicable to your destination. With Rental Car Damage Protector from Allianz Global Assistance, you can get up to $40,000 of primary coverage benefits for loss or collision damage, which can help avoid a personal auto insurance rate increase, offer protection with a $0 deductible and protect you from additional auto rental charges like “loss of use” for the time the rental vehicle is out of commission while damages are being repaired. Terms, conditions, and exclusions apply to all travel insurance plans.

People are engaging on social media apps, reading text messages and e-mails — and even watching videos while behind the wheel.The result has been a surge in distracted-driving deaths, reversing decades of declines due to vehicle safety enhancements.In 2022, more than 46,000 died in motor vehicle incidents and about eight people are killed every day in distracted-driving crashes, according to the National Safety Council.To curtail these deaths, most states have adopted laws barring the use of smartphones while driving.Worse, despite knowing the dangers of using their smartphone while behind the wheel, motorists continue to engage with their devices while driving. A recent study* found an amazing lack of restraint among drivers who said they interact with their smartphone when driving. Here are the main findings: The Biggest Smartphone Distractions The study also found that 19% of drivers used their phone while driving to: When asked about when they use their smartphones while in the car, drivers responded: What to Do If you are one of those who continues to use their smartphone while driving, despite the risks, you should take control.Tip 1:Don't touch your phone.Focus on the road and stay attentive to your environment, other drivers and road conditions.Tip 2:Take the pledge not to use your phone while driving.Make a commitment to: Tip 3:Address your bad habits.Think about what your smartphone is pulling you into doing while driving.

That's why you bought a house with a deck or you built one yourself.Decks are part of the American way of life, but they require upkeep as they are subjected to the elements all year long from hot summer months and cold, rainy or snowy winter months — and everything in between. Collapses happen regularly and people are injured because the owners failed to maintain their deck.Here are the main things you should look for to help reduce the chances of a collapse or other incident. Splintering Boards It's imperative that you check your boards annually. The weather changes from the hot summer months to cold and harsh winters (all of this varies by region, of course), which can lead to splintering. Splintering decks can cause cuts and scrapes, splinters and tripping hazards. Someone wearing flip-flops on the deck can sustain a nasty gash from a splintering board.If you notice any splintering, you should remove the splinters and inspect to see if the entire board needs replacing. Handrails As time marches on and the various weather conditions of the seasons take their toll on your deck, handrails can become less secure and wobbly.Here's what's going on: Warm weather expands the wood, leaving room for the nails and screws to become loose and move. When the cold weather comes and the boards contract, the nails may be in a slightly different position, which when summer comes will make the handrail even less stable.If a handrail is wobbly or bending, it may be time to replace it. Stairs This is another area that causes hundreds of injuries every year. Wear and tear and weather can loosen the stairs much like handrails, but there is an added danger if one step collapses or becomes loose as they can pose tripping hazards, if not worse.If stairs bend when you walk on them or there are splits or splinters in the wood, you should inspect the steps to see if they need replacing. Posts The posts are potential access points for termites, wood-boring beetles or dry rot. Not only that, but the posts are the main support for your deck so it's imperative they remain free of infestation from pests, lest you want to risk the stability of your deck.If the wood is splitting or decaying, you can inspect it by inserting a flathead screwdriver into the cracks or splits. If you can insert it more than 1/4 inch into the wood and the wood feels spongy, you should call an inspector and replace as necessary. Protruding Nails and Screws As mentioned in the handrail section, nails and screws can loosen and start working themselves out of their holes. If they start working their way out, they can protrude from the floor of your deck and cause snag and trip hazards. Not only that, but loose nails and screws can cause boards and support structures to become less stable. Prevention Inspection tip:Get down on your hands and knees periodically and crawl around your deck, which will give you an excellent vantage point to see splinters, raised nails and other hazards that are hard to spot from an adult's perspective. Seeing the world from your pet's or child's point of view will help you spot problems before they become real dangers.Sealer and stain tips:The best way to help prevent wear and tear on your deck is by applying a coat of sealer annually. Sealers protect against moisture that causes rot and splitting, last one cycle of seasons and should be reapplied each year.Also, if you have used stains, paint-maker A.G. Williams recommends that if they are transparent or semi-transparent, you apply sealer on an annual basis. Solid states, which are almost like paint, provide several years of protection and should be recoated every four or five years.

Several other cities across the United States are taking action to encourage the use of smoke alarms. Non-working Smoke Alarms In about 70 percent of recent reported home fires, the home had one or more smoke alarms. Only about 50 percent of those sounded when there was a fire. However, some fires were not serious enough to activate the smoke alarms. In incidents where the fire was bad enough to trigger a fire alarm, the devices went off around 85 percent of the time. Approximately 35 percent of home fire deaths happened because there were no smoke alarms installed. And one percent of the reported deaths happened because of a fire that was not significant enough to activate the smoke alarms. Working Smoke Alarms Save Lives In homes where there are smoke alarms, the risk of dying in a fire is cut in half. However, this statistic is irrelevant if the smoke alarm is not working. To ensure proper function, homeowners or renters must check their alarms regularly. Batteries should be replaced at least once per year with high-quality batteries, and all smoke alarm units should be replaced every 10 years. While it is helpful to have multiple smoke alarms, even one smoke alarm in the home reduces death risk by about 35 percent over homes that do not have any smoke alarms. When alarms fail, they usually do so because of dead batteries, disconnected wires or missing components. Some people disable smoke alarms while cooking or doing something that may set them off. If they reconnect a device improperly, accidentally break it or forget to reconnect the battery, they put themselves at risk. Smoke alarms should never be covered. If a smoke alarm is too sensitive and becomes a nuisance, do not remove or disconnect it. Talk to a local fire department. Relocating the device to another part of the room or replacing it with a high-quality alarm may solve the issue. Also, do not remove smoke alarms from kitchens. Over 40 percent of households with smoke alarms in the kitchen reported that the device went off at least once per year, and this was due to cooking about 75 percent of the time. If an alarm starts making chirping noises, replace the battery immediately. To learn more about safety tips for smoke alarms and how they can protect homes from costly insurance claims, discuss your concerns with an agent.

While it’s sad to think that you won’t be back on your boat until next year, you also need to ensure that you keep her primed and protected by properly preparing for fall and winter. We are offering up the following tips, but remember to also read your owner’s manual for the manufacturer’s recommendations for keeping your boat protected during the colder months: Check Your Insurance Coverage Even out of the water and not in use, a boat can be damaged no matter where it is. Often, damage from fire or theft isn’t covered unless you have a watercraft policy. And any coverage under a homeowners policy doesn’t apply to boats in storage. Also, if the weather suddenly turns beautiful in November and you can’t resist the urge to hit the water, you will want that coverage in place. If you have a small boat with limited power, you may have some coverage under your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance policy. Larger and faster boats, along with personal watercraft, require their own policies. Of course, you may also be wondering if you should keep your vessel insured during the months you won’t be using it. There are a few things to consider here: If you want to save money on your coverage, you should also consider: If you want to know more, give us a call!

That’s a lot of scary weather, and it raises lots of questions. From the difference between advisories, watches and warnings, to the symptoms of hypothermia, to the perils of ice storms, we try to answer them below. What is wind chill? The wind chill temperature is how cold people and animals feel when outside exposed to cold air and wind. Wind makes it feel much colder, and when combined with cold can result in frostbite and hypothermia faster than if there was no wind.  More information, including a Wind Chill Temperature Chart and Times to Frostbite from exposure to cold and wind can be found at:https://www.weather.gov/safety/cold-wind-chill-chart. What is frostbite and what can you do to treat it? Frostbite is when your body tissue freezes. The most susceptible parts of the body are fingers, toes, ear lobes, tips of the nose and eyes.  Symptoms include a loss of feeling in extremities and a white or pale appearance. To treat frostbite: Slowly rewarm the area and seek medical attention immediately.  Do NOT rub the area, apply snow or plunge the affected area into very hot or cold water. What is hypothermia and what are the warning signs? Hypothermia occurs when the body temperature drops to 95 degrees Fahrenheit or lower and develops whenever body heat loss exceeds body heat gain.  Hypothermia is often mistaken for fatigue, irritability or irritability.  Warning signs include uncontrollable shivering, memory loss, disorientation, incoherence, slurred speech, drowsiness and exhaustion. How do you treat hypothermia? What is an ice storm? An ice storm is a prolonged period of rain that freezes when it hits the ground, leaving a significant coating of ice on trees, power lines, buildings, roads, walkways, etc.  An ice storm with ice accumulation that is more than 1 inch thick can paralyze a region for days to a week or more.  Ice storms can bring down trees, topple utility poles and communication towers, and can disrupt communications, power and travel for days or weeks. If an ice storm is in the forecast, be sure to stock up on at least 72 hours of food, water, medicine and other life-critical supplies. What do the various winter weather advisories, watches and warnings mean? The National Weather Service issues advisories, watches and warnings individually or for a combination of any of the following: snow, blowing snow, freezing rain, sleet and dangerous wind chills. What is lake effect snow? Lake effect snow occurs when cold air passes over a large warmer lake, such as one of the Great Lakes.  The warmer lake and cold air creates an unstable atmosphere.  The air streams over the warmer lake and picks up some of the moisture and heat from the Great Lakes. In combination with unstable air, it creates snow showers. Those snow showers move with the wind into areas downstream of the Great Lakes. Lake effect snow can create a local, intense and narrow band of moderate to heavy snow that can extend inland as far east as across the entire Lower Peninsula. Lake effect snow may also be accompanied by strong, gusty winds and possibly lightning. Snowfall rates in the most intense lake effect events can reach 3 to 5 inches per hour! Areas that are most susceptible to lake effect snows are northern upper Michigan, western lower Michigan and northeastern Illinois. What are the various winter weather warnings and advisories?

The combination of early sunset, increased traffic and pedestrians, scam artists, vandals and thieves, and people in a rush can sometimes be a deadly combination. Unfortunately, just a momentary distraction or lapse in judgment can lead to tragedy. Fourteen percent of all collisions in the U.S. each year happen in parking lots and can result in costly insurance claims for vehicle damage. Even worse, if you strike and injure a pedestrian, the costs are even higher in terms of both dollars and emotional distress.

Maybe you bought a trip to Bangkok or London, or perhaps you’re doing a tour of Civil War sites in the South. While the chances of you being affected by violence on vacation are typically low, there are other risks that you need to consider: like an unexpected problem at home – such as a plumbing leak – when you are thousands of miles away, having valuables stolen, injuring yourself in a scooter crash or having your personal data hijacked. Although the idea of taking a vacation is to leave your everyday life behind for a while, if you fail to take certain actions ahead of time, you could end up being hit with a nasty surprise. These are some of the precautions you can take:  Batten the Hatches If you think burglary is the biggest risk to your unoccupied home when you are away, you will be surprised to know that according to the Insurance Information Institute, the average post-vacation burglary claim is for $3,990, while the average loss cost for water-related damage is more than $8,800. While you may think that a small leak can’t cause much damage, it can if left unattended. While a leak when you are at home may go undetected for a day or two, if nobody is home at all, it can cause serious damage since nobody is there to stop it. The time between when a leak occurs and when it’s discovered directly impacts the severity (and cost) of water damage. Here’s what you could do to help mitigate:  If You Bring Jewelry, Check Your Coverage While the smartest choice is to leave expensive jewelry at home, some people do like to bring it along. A typical homeowner’s policy has a cap on valuables, so you may want to consider a jewelry rider providing worldwide all-risk coverage to your homeowner’s policy. Help take care of your jewelry:  Go Low-Tech While you may be tempted to share your vacation photos live or the same day you take them on Facebook or Instagram, there is a chance this can tip off would-be thieves that your home is unattended. If you are sharing, make sure you have your Facebook privacy settings to friends and family only, and consider postponing uploads to the more open Instagram. Also, don’t use the “check-in” function or hashtags, as doing so can alert local thieves that a potentially gullible tourist is in the vicinity. Also, unsecured Wi-Fi networks are prevalent in hotel lobbies, restaurants and other tourist destinations. Vigilant hackers can gain entry into your mobile device and your personal data on these networks, so use with care.  Travel Confidently Travel insurance can be relatively inexpensive, especially when you consider how much you could lose if something goes wrong before or during your trip. Trip-cancellation, accidents, medical emergencies, illness — even lost baggage — all can quickly add up. AAA and Allianz Travel Insurance offer you expertise, stability and peace of mind to make your travel plans today. Learn more!

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/why-meemic/blog/claims-safety/5-myths-about-auto-theft: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Share This Article: 5 Myths About Auto Theft According to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center, one vehicle is stolen about every 30 seconds in the U.S., which amounts to more than 1 million stolen U.S. vehicles annually and upwards of $7.6 billion in vehicle losses. Despite the tremendous expense involved when a car is stolen, many consumers still aren’t preparing in advance to handle the possibility of a vehicle theft. A number of common misconceptions have contributed to consumers adopting a defeatist attitude about vehicle theft. There are a number of vehicle owners that feel it’s all but impossible to prevent becoming a victim of vehicle theft, even when protective methods like anti-theft devices are used. This type of defeatist attitude can have serious and unnecessary consequences for vehicle owners. The Wiser Drivers Wise Up project was started by the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the Insurance Information Institute and the National Insurance Crime Bureau to dispel the defeatist attitude and teach drivers how to handle their vehicle being stolen. The program includes five auto theft myths that can actually leave a vehicle owner more vulnerable to having their vehicle stolen:  1. Older Vehicles Aren’t Targeted by Thieves Statistics clearly show this myth isn’t true. For example, the National Insurance Crime Bureau reports that among the top stolen model years for 2014 were: 1994 Honda Accord, 1995 Honda Civic, 1991 Toyota Camry, 1997 Ford F-150 Pickup and 2004 Dodge Ram Pickup. 2. The Majority of Vehicle Thefts Occur in Unprotected Areas Again, statistics clearly disprove this myth. According to one FBI report on the subject, more than a third of all vehicle thefts take place from a home. The same report showed that only two in 10 vehicle thefts take place in a parking lot and that only a very small number of vehicles are stolen or carjacked along roadways, highways and alleys. So, parking in an area felt to be secure doesn’t decrease the likelihood of your vehicle being stolen. 3. Anti-Theft Devices Aren’t Hard to Install Unless you’re trained on the complexities of a vehicle’s electronic workings, then it’s best to pay for a professional to install, wire and test the anti-theft device for you. It might be tempting to go with the cheapest price, but keep in mind that a cheap price doesn’t always equate to a bargain. Check with the Better Business Bureau to help you determine if the installer is running a reputable business, especially if a business is offering a substantial price difference from their competitors. If the technician that will be installing your alarm system hasn’t been certified by the Mobile Electronics Certification Program (MECP), then you might want to consider a different installer. Make sure that the installer provides instruction on how the alarm system works and is operated. You will also want a written warranty from the installer. 4. The Police Usually Find Stolen Vehicles Only half of all stolen vehicles are ever recovered. The first few days following the theft will be critical, as the chance of recovery diminishes with each day the thief possesses it. The highest number of vehicle thefts occur on Saturdays and Fridays. The highest number of recoveries are from vehicle thefts occurring on a Monday or Tuesday. 5. Insurance Companies Always Provide Victims with a Rental Car Check your policy; while theft coverage is part of a comprehensive auto insurance policy, it may or may not include a rental replacement car following a theft. Vehicle owners shouldn’t make the costly mistake of assuming vehicle theft is an inevitable occurrence. It’s also advisable to do an annual review of your auto policy for mandatory coverages, needed coverages and coverage features like rentals and roadside assistance.

With newer features being added to all types of vehicles, it is important for drivers to learn how they work to increase their own safety. While it is useful to learn about all of the new technologies, it is especially important to learn the ones that promote safer driving and enhance driving abilities. Researchers have been collecting data for more than a decade, and they have identified which technologies are the most beneficial options for mature drivers. To determine which ones were also the most favorable for this age group, they explored drivers' confidence and comfort when using various technologies. The research included a review of new technologies by experts. These leading experts included researchers and practitioners with experience in kinesiology, geriatric medicine, occupational therapy and human factors. Expert panels pinpointed 10 top technologies that promote confidence, convenience and capacity for aging drivers. Smart headlights came in at the top of the list.

But while these smart keys have made starting, locking and unlocking your car easier than ever, thieves have figured out a way to commandeer the technology to steal cars. They do this using a system called a “relay attack.” To avoid becoming a victim of this kind of theft, there are steps you can take to help protect your vehicle. The Fob Weakness Modern key fobs are electronically linked to our vehicles, and they communicate using a low-energy wireless signal. When the driver is near their vehicle and the car validates the fob signal, the fob can unlock the car and once inside start it simply by the driver pressing a dashboard button. And when the car is parked and locked it is always scanning to detect a signal from the fob that is linked to it. Upon detection, it grants access to the locks and ignition. But these systems have a weakness that criminals can take advantage of using a relay attack. Thieves use specialized electronic equipment that can locate and amplify the signals of your fob to another device that impersonates your key. It takes a thief and an accomplice to pull these thefts off. One has to be near you and/or your key fob and, using their equipment, they can detect the fob signal, amplify it and transmit it over a significant distance to a device that the thief has near your car. This device can then mimic your fob and the car will allow the thief to open the doors and start the ignition. In other words, these devices bridge the gap in proximity to fool your vehicle into thinking its fob is just a foot or two away — even if it’s not. Thieves can carry out a relay attack in your driveway by sniffing out a signal from the key fob in your home. Or they can stake out a parking lot and target a vehicle; one of the criminals follows you into the store and hijacks your fob signal and transmits it to their accomplice, who is in the parking lot next to your car. How to Help Protect Your Car Fortunately, you can take steps to help reduce the chances of having your fob signal intercepted and used to steal your vehicle: This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

The life you save may be your own. Thanks to mandatory seat belt laws in the vast majority of jurisdictions, drivers and passengers are more likely to wear seat belts now than they ever have been. In 2000, drivers used seat belts about 79% of the time. Today, that number is over 90%. Every state in the country now has some type of mandatory seat belt use law except New Hampshire, and all 50 states and the District of Columbia have child safety seat laws. That said, some people still don’t buckle up. Seat Belt Use Saves Lives Don’t think seat belts save lives? Consider the following from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Highway Loss Data Institute: The number of lives saved due to seat belt use has been consistently over 12,000 per year every year since at least 2010. Survival Tips Heed the following tips, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, to safeguard yourself, your passengers and family: Pay close attention to rear seat passengers. Studies show that rear seat passengers are 10% more likely to neglect to wear their seat belts. But rear seat passengers made up 26% of motor vehicle accident passenger deaths in 2012.

These programs have prevented thousands of crimes each month across the United States, and more neighborhoods are joining the fight every year. Citizen-based neighborhood watch programs have been around since the colonial days when night watchmen took turns patrolling the village. The modern form of this developed when police chiefs and sheriffs were looking for ways to put citizens in more proactive roles to address a growing burglary problem. Neighborhood Watch was a special program developed and named in 1972. It connected law enforcement with citizens to provide important training. Citizens learned how to watch for suspicious activities and report them. By working together with neighbors to take shifts for watching, neighborhood residents who participated in the original program helped cut crime in their local areas. After just 10 years of the program being in existence, the National Security Agency reported that 12 percent of the population participated in Neighborhood Watch. How to Start a Neighborhood Watch Program Starting a program is easy when people have willing neighbors. Most homeowners are concerned about protecting their property, and this is especially true when they know that a safer neighborhood means higher property values, as well. These are some helpful tips for starting a program: Proper training is essential before assuming watch duties. Participants should understand that a watch program does not create vigilante roles. Everyone should know when and how to contact law enforcement for help when needed. This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

Take Extra Precautions to Keep Kids Out of Hot Cars In 2017, 43 young children have died of heatstroke after being left or trapped in vehicles. This is about double the number of children who died this way during the same period last year. According to CNN, a 3-year-old boy in Houston died in July when he was left in a bus after a day care field trip. Records from the day care show the boy had erroneously been accounted for as the group reassembled after the trip. Earlier this year, in May, a 1-year-old girl died in Tennessee after her father forgot to drop her off at her daycare before heading out of town on a business trip. The stories seem endless. Dozens of children die each year this way, according to NoHeatStroke.org, all over the United States. Driving in Work Zones Takes Extra Caution Some of the riskiest locations for roadway collisions are work zones, as they often result in changes in traffic patterns and right of way, along with workers present and large commercial vehicles on the scene. Work zones are designed to improve the safety of workers who are enhancing or repairing roads, freeways, bridges, sewage and other infrastructure by separating construction and maintenance activities from traffic. The crews do that by providing a safe route for motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists and a safe area for the workers on the scene. That stew of activity and unpredictability sadly results in fatal accidents. In 2019, 842 people died in work zones in the U.S., up from 757 in 2018.

In a scene that’s becoming increasingly common after a catastrophe, unscrupulous “storm chasers” are targeting people whose homes and premises have been damaged after a calamity, be that a snowstorm, tornado or a storm system, such as those that ravaged the West Coast in early 2023. Unfortunately, bad actors target homeowners when they are at their most vulnerable, and you should be wary of anyone who shows up at your door immediately after a storm. If someone pitches up offering to step in and handle repairs and your insurance, you should not take them up on their offer. Protecting Your Home Against Garage Fires After the kitchen, the garage is the second-most common place in the home where fires start. There are some 6,600 garage fires that cause an estimated $457 million in property losses every year, according to the U.S. Fire Administration. The danger is that these fires, after they start, are rarely confined to the garage, easily spreading into adjacent parts of the house and beyond. One reason garages are especially prone to fires is that many homeowners store chemicals and flammable liquids, boxes with personal effects, clothes and other flammable materials in them.

Smartphones Can Spell Trouble for Drivers Distracted driving has skyrocketed in the past 13 years and experts say that smartphones are to blame. People are engaging on social media apps, reading text messages and e-mails — and even watching videos while behind the wheel. The result has been a surge in distracted-driving deaths, reversing decades of declines due to vehicle safety enhancements. In 2022, more than 46,000 died in motor vehicle incidents and about eight people are killed every day in distracted-driving crashes, according to the National Safety Council. Fix Deck Problems Before Someone Is Injured Everyone loves to spend time on the deck with the family or entertaining. That's why you bought a house with a deck or you built one yourself.

There are about 400,000 residential property fires in the U.S. each year, and these residential fires account for more than 3,700 human fatalities each year. Even when all other natural disasters are combined, fires still typically claim more American lives per year.Considering the cost, frequency and loss of life related to residential fires, it’s important for homeowners to have loss control measures in place. A fire extinguisher may seem like a simple item, but when properly selected, placed and maintained, a fire extinguisher can be a powerful tool to prevent widespread fire loss. The best thing is that a fire extinguisher is a relatively cheap investment, as prices start at around $20.It’s important to become familiar with the different classes of fire extinguishers. There are five classes, with each class based on what type of fire the extinguisher is capable of extinguishing. The five extinguisher classes are marked with a class specific color, geometric symbol, and/or picture.Because fires may often involve a combination of elements, most fire protection experts recommend a fire extinguisher with an ABC rating.Class A Fire ExtinguisherColor - greenGeometric symbol - trianglePicture - burning garbage can and woodpileThis class of fire extinguisher is intended to be used on ordinary solid combustibles. These types of fires might involve cloth, wood, rubber, paper or certain types of plastic.Class B Fire ExtinguisherColor - redGeometric symbol - squarePicture - container of fuel and burning puddleThis class of fire extinguisher is intended to be used on flammable liquids and gasses. These types of fires might involve lacquers, gasoline, alcohol, diesel oil, oil-based paints or flammable gas.Class C Fire ExtinguisherColor - blueGeometric symbol - circlePicture - burning outlet and electric cord plugThis class of fire extinguisher is intended to be used on energized electrical equipment.

The “witches” are often caused by intense, low atmospheric pressure over the Great Lakes that pulls cold Canadian air from the north and warm Gulf air in from the south. When these extreme temperatures of hot and cold collide, they can result in hurricane force winds that stir up massive waves in the Lakes and send those gusts onto land. Combine the warm water with blasts of winter-like cold, and you've got the recipe for intensifying storm systems.To help prepare for especially windy days, we have compiled some tips to keep you and your belongings safe and secure.

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/member-services/safety-information-center/consumer-guide-to-collision-repair: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Share This Article: Consumer Guide to Collision Repair* No vehicle owner expects to be involved in an accident. But, at some point, you may be faced with damage to your vehicle as the result of a collision. Vehicle repairs can be handled better by an informed consumer. Meemic wants you to know your rights before you authorize repairs to your vehicle and recommends that you visit your state’s Bureau of Regulatory Services (or similar licensing department) before authorizing your vehicle’s repairs. This guide describes what is involved when collision repairs are needed and provides some details on your rights as a consumer. Each state may have its own legislative rules governing collision repairs, so it is important to know your rights as they relate to your specific resident state.Vehicle Design Most vehicles manufactured since 1980 are of a design known as unitized body (commonly known as unibody) construction. This design is particularly good at absorbing collision impacts and minimizing injury to vehicle occupants. The ability to absorb collision impact is accomplished by creating “crush zones” in the vehicle that absorb and redirect the impact energy to other areas of the vehicle outside the passenger compartment. Unitized body construction relies on a number of lightweight, high-strength steel panels and parts, properly welded together, to provide structural strength. Due to the energy-absorbing nature of the design, even relatively minor appearing accidents can result in damage that may affect the structural integrity of the vehicle. Proper training and equipment are necessary for the repair facility you choose to correctly diagnose and repair your vehicle. A poorly repaired vehicle may be unsafe and can cost you money.Your Right to Choose Most states allow you to choose where your vehicle will be repaired. Your insurance company may provide you with a list of possible repair facilities and may recommend shops through a referral network if permitted in your state. The repair facility you choose should meet the requirements listed below.What You Should Look for in a Repair Facility Many states require that automotive repair shops post customers’ rights and their license in a visible location. The consumer information sign advises you of your rights and what you are entitled to by law. Further, mechanics who repair collision-damaged unitized body vehicles may be required by law to be certified in the category of Unitized Body Structural Repair. The mechanic’s certificate must be posted in a conspicuous location as well if required If your state requires registration, the mechanic’s certificate and the information sign should be accessible and, if you do not see them, ask the service manager or owner about them. If they cannot be shown to you, you should consider taking your vehicle elsewhere. Only do business with a repair facility that can demonstrate that it has properly trained certified mechanics who will work on your vehicle and meets all the necessary licensing required for your state.Repairs to Be Performed When you receive a written estimate for the work that will be done, be sure you understand the extent of repairs that will be performed and the type of parts that will be used. The abbreviation “LKQ” stands for “Like Kind and Quality” and is another way of saying the part is used and not new. Never allow a repair facility to install used safety items, such as a supplemental inflatable restraint system (air bag). Many states require that a collision repair facility inform you in writing if the replacement parts used to repair your vehicle are not OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer, the company that manufactured your vehicle). Parts not produced by the vehicle manufacturer, if used, may void the manufacturer’s warranty in certain applications. Before authorizing collision repairs, make sure you are aware of the type of parts being used in your vehicle’s repairs and discuss any concerns or questions with the repair facility and your insurance company.Will There Be a Warranty? Before allowing the repair facility to begin repairs, find out if the facility provides a warranty on its work. A repair facility may not be required to provide a warranty. If a warranty is provided, the terms and any exclusions must be in writing. If you are told the repair to your vehicle will be warranted, make sure you receive a written copy of the warranty.Special Deals or Discounts Be wary of repair facilities that offer to waive your insurance deductible or do more work for no extra charge. Needed repairs could be short-cut to offset the added expense the repair facility will incur. Since the structural integrity of your unitized body vehicle is extremely dependent upon proper repairs being performed, never agree to something that could affect your safety and the safety of your passengers.In the Event of an Accident No one wants to be in an accident. If you are, it is important that key facts be obtained for later use. The items below may help you obtain needed information.Keep this guide in your glove compartment, so that you can write down the information immediately in the event of an accident. Date and time of accident: Names and addresses of others involved: Names and addresses of witnesses: Name of other party’s insurance company and agent: Other party’s policy number: Investigating police department: Police report number: *Source:Consumer’s Guide to Collision Repairs, Bureau of Regulatory Services, Michigan Department of State.This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

If you are planning to be away from home for an extended period, follow these simple steps to minimize your risk: If you are planning a trip, do not leave your water on with lowered heat in the house. This combination can cause frozen pipes in the event of a power outage.

It's true, and it's a scary reality for parents to face. But there are steps you can take to keep your teen drivers as safe as possible — even when you're not in the car with them. Practice, Practice, Practice The best way to ensure they're good drivers when you're not around is to start by making sure they're good when you are around. So, you should set aside a specific practice day each week — even after they get their license — so you can continue to provide feedback and keep an eye on how they're doing. Just Say No The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration agrees that one of the most important things you can do as a parent is limit your teen driver's distractions and risks. That means making sure they know that when they're behind the wheel, it's always no phone, no speeding and no drugs or alcohol. Limit the Number of Passengers Having just one teen passenger in the car increases your teen's risk of having an accident by 44%. And if that passenger is a sibling, the distractions could be even greater than if it's a friend. If possible, keep young passengers out of the car while your teen is driving for at least a year. They Notice When You Buckle Up Maybe they're not always great at listening to what you say, but your teens do notice what you do. In fact, research shows that parents who wear seatbelts have children who wear seatbelts — and, if your teen is in a crash, that seatbelt could make a life or death difference. Know the Laws Did you know that, in Michigan, teen drivers can be fined for using a phone while driving — even if it's hands-free — unless it's to report an accident, a crime or an emergency? Michigan has specific Graduated Driver Licensing (or GDL) laws that your teen will need to work up through before gaining full driving privileges. The Car Can Make All the Difference You don't want to break the bank on your teen's first car — but you want to make sure you're keeping them as safe as possible. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety publishes a list of safe and affordable vehicles that can help you make the best choice for your child. Put It in Writing Make your teen commit to the safe driving rules you set by having them sign a contract—and make sure there are consequences when they don't follow the rules. You'll find a lot of contracts already written for you by searching online, or you can create your own. Understand the Risks One of the best ways to get your teen drivers off to a safe start is by discussing the risks with them. The numbers don't lie — car crashes are the #1 cause of teen death in the U.S.Download and print this infographicto help you talk to your teen about the dangers they'll face on the road.

That’s easier to do if you’re driving cautiously, and not tailgating, so you have more time to see and react to any potholes you’re approaching.Potholes aren’t always obvious in the daylight; they’re even harder to spot in the dark. Make sure your headlights are working and your windshield is clear.Be extra cautious around puddles – they could be potholes filled with water. Since water is a critical component to forming potholes, that puddle may be at work creating one as you drive through it.Keep a firm grip on your steering wheel as potholes can cause your vehicle to change direction suddenly. Don’t swerve into an occupied lane. No one wants pothole damage to escalate to a collision causing further damage or injury. Vehicle Maintenance Helps Unquestionably, hitting potholes can damage your vehicle. However, there are some things you can do to keep it to a minimum.Make sure your tires are properly inflated. Over- or under-inflated tires fare worse when they tangle with a pothole. Tires showing excessive wear or bulges in the sidewalls won’t hold up as well to potholes, either.Have your vehicle’s suspension and steering components checked out by a qualified mechanic. Steering that is in good condition and responsive can help you avoid hitting potholes. Remember that shocks, struts and springs in good shape help cushion the blow. There’s a Technique to This There are often two schools of thought on driving through potholes: speeding up to \"jump\" over them and jamming the brakes hard to hit them as slowly as possible. Both might work occasionally, but the best way is somewhere in between.If you see a pothole ahead and can’t safely steer to avoid it, it’s best to slow down, then release the brakes before you hit the pothole. This helps to reduce the speed at impact as well as gives your suspension the full range of travel to absorb the impact. If you can’t avoid the pothole, straighten your wheel to hit it squarely and roll through. Hitting a pothole at an angle can transfer the energy of impact in ways more likely to damage your vehicle. You Hit One. Now What? Tire and wheel damage are common in pothole hits. Look them over for obvious damage. Is your car now pulling one way or the other? You may need to get your steering realigned. Is your vehicle now “bottoming out” or bouncing? That could be damaged suspension. You probably should get your vehicle checked out and repaired, if necessary. A properly maintained vehicle can help you avoid all sorts of road hazards.  Source:MDOTThis information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

This finding confirms what experts suspected, which was that drowsy drivers are more commonplace than other statistics suggested before. Experts recommend drivers learn and remember the signs of fatigue to avoid injuring themselves and other motorists.Researchers also found that crashes due to drowsy drivers have serious consequences. Injuries resulted in more than 30 percent of the crashes, and approximately 6,000 crashes end in one or more fatalities. Prior findings from top research reports showed that drivers between the ages of 19 and 24 were more likely to admit they were drowsy. However, drivers younger than 18 and older than 75 were less likely to admit when they were drowsy.Research also showed that more than 90 percent of Americans said they thought it was unacceptable for people to drive while drowsy, but nearly 30 percent admitted to doing just that in the past 30 days. It is important to know how to identify the signs of drowsy driving. This includes the following: When drivers feel tired, experts recommend finding a safe place to pull to the side of the road. It is important to do this if any of the previous symptoms are noted. To keep safe on the road, experts recommend the following tips: Drowsy drivers make the road unsafe for themselves, their passengers and other motorists.

While a soft spring rain may seem innocent enough from the safety of your home, even a gentle shower can cause major problems on the road. Thousands of car accidents each year are caused by rain and wet roads — and motorists who don’t know how to drive on them. During and after a rainstorm, a film of water quickly forms on asphalt roads. This sheath of water causes tires to lose traction, which means drivers can easily lose control.However, slippery roads are not the only danger to driving in the rain. Drivers also lose visibility during a rainstorm. Heavy rain can be absolutely blinding, fogging up the windows and even blocking your headlights. These things all add to an extremely dangerous situation.

Fewer hours of daylight make it more difficult to see pedestrians, cyclists and children playing in the late afternoon. Also, later sunrises mean that drivers need to adjust to the brighter sun at different times of the morning. Always keep a pair of sunglasses in your car to shield your vision.Avoid driving over wet leaves.Fall foliage is beautiful, but once those leaves start falling and get wet from rain, they can become a serious driving hazard. Wet leaves are slippery and reduce traction.Be careful with leaf piles.If leaves are raked onto the street for collection, parking on top of them can be a fire hazard. Also, there may be children playing in the piles.Don’t Veer for Deer.If a crash with a deer is unavoidable, remember don’t swerve. Be sure to brake firmly and hold onto the steering wheel with both hands. Come to a controlled stop and move the vehicle out of traffic to a safe location.Prepare an emergency kit for your car.Carrying an emergency kit in your car trunk or cargo area can be a real lifesaver. Be sure to include a flashlight, flares and a first-aid kit, jumper cables, extra washer fluid, nonperishable food, a jug of water, and a few basic tools such as wrenches, a ratchet/socket set, screwdrivers and pliers.Watch for frost.Low nighttime temperatures cause frost on windshields and roads. Be sure to clear your windshield completely before driving. Also, slow down when approaching bridges and overpasses, as these structures are more prone to collect frost on the roadway surface. Stay alert for shaded areas that could create black ice during early morning and evening hours.Plan ahead for changing weather conditions.Have your car winterized before the winter storm season sets in. Keeping your car in good condition decreases your chance of being stranded in cold weather. Also, be sure to have a first-aid kit, thermal blanket, a working flashlight, a shovel and sand in your car.Watch for construction work zones.Construction work zones may still be active. Please remember to slow down and pay attention in work zones. The life you save could be your own. Source:MDOTThis information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

But, that doesn’t mean you should take the bike away and lock it up for good! Here are a few ideas for how you can help your children stay as safe as possible, and still let them have fun riding with friends. Not All Helmets Are the Same You want to buy a helmet with a sticker that says it meets the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) standards. And you need to make sure it fits your child properly! It should be comfortably snug all the way around and it should remain in place when your child shakes his or her head. Size Matters When fitting an adult bike, it’s usually done by frame size. But when you’re choosing a bike for your child, it should be done by wheel size instead. So, before you go shopping, make sure you know your child’s height (inseam measurement can be helpful too), because that’s what you’ll use to choose the proper wheel size. When Can These Things Come Off?!?! If your child hasn’t already started asking you to remove the training wheels, they will. Unfortunately, there’s no set-in-stone rule for when it’s safe to take them off. Many experts say that around age 5 is the right time, but nobody knows your child better than you do. Use your judgment and make sure you’re there to pick them up and encourage them when they fall. Every Month Is Bike Safety Month However, May is the month when we really celebrate it. National Bike Safety Month is sponsored by the League of American Bicyclists. May 4th is Bike to School Day and May 20th is Bike to Work Day. So get out there and enjoy it with your kids – and make sure you set a good example for how to ride safely. Bicycle Friendly State℠ Rankings Every year, the League of American Bicyclists ranks all 50 states based on how bike-friendly they are. In 2022, Michigan ranked #11.View the full list of rankingsto find out which state came in at #1. Share the Road Even before your child is old enough to ride in the road, get them in the habit of using appropriate hand signals to communicate with drivers. For a left turn, extend your left arm outward. For a right turn, extend your left arm and bend it upward 90 degrees at the elbow. And to indicate stopping or slowing down, extend your left arm and bend it downward at 90 degrees with your palm facing back. Ride Together The best way to turn your child into a safe biker — and to make sure you know you can trust them on their own — is to spend as much time as possible riding with them! So, dust off your old bike and get out there for some quality riding/observing time. Understand the Risks One of the best ways to get your child off to a fun, safe start is to discuss the rules and the risks with them.Download and print this child bike safety infographicto help start the conversation.

These contractors typically advertise that they will cover your deductible and that they work directly with your insurance company. Frequently, they are unreliable companies that will not guarantee their work. Even if a warranty is promised, the company will be nowhere to be found in months and years to come. These companies will appear after large storms (e.g., hail storms) and will make promises and false statements in an attempt to perform work on your home that is not necessary. They have even been known to tell unsuspecting people that their home has been damaged when it hasn’t. You can protect yourself from these unreliable contractors by following a few simple steps: Typically, these contractors will leave ﬂyers on your door informing you that your home has been damaged by weather (e.g., hail) and they have even been known to show photos of roof damage that isn’t yours. Remember, unnecessary insurance claims or roof repairs will impact everyone’s premium regardless of what these contractors tell you. Protect yourself and your home. Always use licensed, local contractors that have good reviews and references. Your local Meemic agent may also be able to provide Meemic contractor program options.

The popularity of this mode of transportation is attributed to the low initial cost of a motorcycle, its use as a pleasure vehicle and, for some models, the good fuel efficiency. According to the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration, motorcycle fatalities represent approximately 11 percent of all highway fatalities each year, yet motorcycles represent approximately 3 percent of all registered vehicles in the United States. One of the main reasons motorcyclists are killed in crashes is because the motorcycle itself provides virtually no protection in a crash. For example, approximately 80 percent of reported motorcycle crashes result in injury or death; a comparable figure for automobiles is about 20 percent. Buying a Motorcycle After You Buy, Before You Ride The safe operation of a motorcycle requires different skill and knowledge than is needed for a passenger car.

By implementing a good set of safety rules, parents can help keep their kids and visitors safe. Some people may think it sounds rude to lay down a list of rules in front of pool guests, but the cost of a liability lawsuit would be much worse. To avoid sounding like a stickler, simply explain to pool guests that their safety is important. Explain that they can help out by following the safety rules. Parents should review these rules with children frequently. Quiz them on each point to ensure they understand thoroughly. The following tips are helpful for developing a strong set of pool and spa safety rules. 1. Specify all requirements. This should be the most important step. Decide who can go in the pool and at what time. For example, children should have specific blocks of time when they are allowed in the pool, and they should not be allowed to go in when an adult is not present. Teach them it is dangerous to run. Instead of just telling them not to run, explain how they can slip, fall into the pool and possibly drown. Discourage horseplay or rough water games. Children who cannot get along in the pool should understand that there will be consequences. Kids should also understand how important it is to stay away from drains and filters.2. Have an emergency plan.Even if strict rules are set in place, pool accidents may still happen. It is important to know what to do. Make sure a cordless phone is always near the pool. If an accident happens, it will be easier for someone to call 911. Adults should learn how to perform CPR. The Red Cross offers low-cost classes, and some hospitals or health clinics offer free classes. Make sure kids know how to dial 911, and they should know what address to tell emergency response teams to locate. Create a pool safety kit that includes a first aid kit and pair of sharp and durable scissors to cut a pool cover, clothing or hair if needed.3. Teach kids how to swim.Although toddlers may not be up for actual swimming lessons, it is good to put them in the water with floating pool toys. Do not leave them alone, but let them get accustomed to the water. When children are old enough for swimming lessons, enroll them in beginner courses. Let them continue until they complete all of the courses. Adults who have never taken swimming lessons should also learn how to swim. As a backup, it is helpful to have a life-saving floating raft attached to a rope or pole.4. Keep the pool area safe.When the pool is not in use, make sure it is covered. Purchase a pool cover manufactured by professionals. Never use a tarp. Some nets work well as pool covers, but they become weathered over time, so be sure to replace them every few years. Nets may also be easy for some children to remove. The optimal choice is a durable hard cover with a locking mechanism. Make sure there is a fence around the pool or yard. The fence should stand at least 4 feet high. If a house is used as a fourth side to enclose a pool, install door alarms. This will alert parents when kids enter the pool area. It is also helpful to install underwater alarms or surface wave alarms. If parents do not deactivate these alarms, they will go off when kids enter the pool.5. Create a safe swimming area.Make sure everyone who takes a dip follows your pool rules. Here are a few safety tips to keep in mind: If a child is missing, be sure to check the pool first. This is a thought that no parent wants to dwell on, but it is best to rule out that possibility first. Parents should always carefully watch kids who are playing in the pool. Accidents can happen in a second, and children can start drowning in less than a minute. Check drain covers frequently, and make sure they are compliant with current regulations. A pool service company will be able to provide information about current drain cover specifications. Remember to keep any gates to the pool area locked. Homeowners may be liable for uninvited people who wander into an unlocked pool area and get injured.  This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

If lint accumulates in the dryer vent, it could cause a fire in your home. The National Fire Protection Association says there are almost 14,000 clothes dryer fires on average annually in the U.S., amounting to 13 deaths, 444 injuries and about $238 million in estimated property damage. These fires start when dryer vents become blocked by lint, the heat produced by the dryer cannot escape fast enough through the blocked vent, and the lint ignites from the trapped heat. Look for these warning signs of inadequate clothes drying venting: Check with your local city or community ordinance codes to see if they require metal dryer venting. Vinyl, plastic and foil venting accumulates lint more easily and can collapse when installed. Metal has been deemed more reliable by the Underwriters Laboratories standards.

It is created by burning oil, coal, charcoal, propane, natural gas and kerosene. Any appliances or equipment using these types of fuel can produce carbon monoxide. Although most people are not aware what is happening to them when they are poisoned by carbon monoxide, more than 150 people die every year from inhaling the fumes. This number excludes automotive-related deaths from carbon monoxide. Malfunctioning appliances and the improper use of charcoal grills are two common causes of death. Another unfortunate but common cause of carbon monoxide poisoning is the improper use of a generator. Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Since the gas itself cannot be detected by human senses, people do not immediately know they have been exposed to it. The first symptoms of moderate poisoning are nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness and shortness of breath. Serious side effects include loss of muscle function, mental confusion, vomiting and loss of consciousness. People who experience severe side effects often die. The severity of symptoms depends on the person's exposure level to carbon monoxide. Getting help immediately is important to avoid death. Preventing Carbon Monoxide Poisoning When installing appliances that use gas or solid fuel, it is important to follow the manufacturer's warnings and instructions. Do not cover them with foil or use them without a proper ventilation system. It is also important to keep local building codes in mind. Homeowners should have appliances installed by qualified professionals, and all fuel-based appliances should be inspected annually and serviced as recommended by the manufacturer. Have chimneys inspected and cleaned annually as well. Avoid using a portable generator or grill in an enclosed area. Do not leave a vehicle running in an attached garage whether the door is open or closed.Another important step to take is to install a CO detector that complies with the UL 2034 safety standard. When installed in a home, these detectors are successful in alerting home occupants when carbon monoxide is present. Install alarms on all floors of the home in the hallways close to each separate sleeping area. Never cover an alarm with curtains, furniture or any other decorations. Suspected Alarm Malfunction Protocol People who believe that their carbon monoxide detectors are malfunctioning should replace them. If symptoms of poisoning appear but the alarm is not sounding, the first step is to go outside immediately. Fresh air exposure is important. Use a neighbor's phone or a cell phone to call the local fire department from outside. Staying inside of the affected home could result in loss of consciousness and death.See a doctor immediately. In some cases, the symptoms may be due to another cause. It is still always best to replace any suspected nonfunctioning alarms. When poisoning is confirmed by a physician, do not return to the home immediately. Have a qualified professional inspect any chimneys and appliances before returning to the home. Replace all carbon monoxide detectors after the professional confirms that it is safe to return home. Alarms are built to alert people when possible life-threatening levels of carbon monoxide are present. However, any device has the capability to malfunction. This is why it is good to have multiple detectors throughout the home. Testing a Carbon Monoxide Detector Save the instructions that come with the alarm. Use them to test the product as recommended by the manufacturer. Keep in mind that test buttons indicate functionality in the circuitry but not necessarily in the detection components. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations about how often to replace alarms. Installing a Carbon Monoxide Detector Follow the manufacturer's instructions for installing the alarm. Every separate sleeping area of the home should have one. If there are two separate sleeping areas on the main floor and one upstairs, plan to buy three alarms. Some alarms are installed in a wall outlet or on the top side of the wall depending on how the alarm is made. Do not place detectors near heating sources or fuel-burning appliances.By following these simple tips, it is easier to reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. To learn more, discuss concerns with an agent. ​This information is being provided for general informational purposes only.

People living in rural areas are more than twice as likely to die in a fire as those living in mid-sized cities or suburban areas. The misuse of wood stoves, fireplaces, portable space heaters and kerosene heaters is especially common in rural areas. The United States Fire Administration (USFA) believes fire problems can be reduced by teaching people to recognize potential hazards. And remember: Having a working smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector (with battery backup) dramatically increases your chances of surviving a fire. Practice a home escape plan frequently with your family. The following precautionary steps can greatly reduce an individual’s chances of becoming a fire casualty: Electric Space Heaters Only buy heaters with the Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) safety listing. Check to make sure it has a thermostat control mechanism and will switch off automatically if the heater tips over. “Space” heaters need their space. They are not dryers or tables; don't dry clothes or store objects on top of your heater.  Keep combustibles at least three feet away. Never use an extension cord and always unplug your electric space heater when it is not in use. Kerosene Heaters Buy only UL-approved heaters, and check with your local fire department on the legality of using a kerosene heater in your community. Never fill your heater with gasoline or camp stove fuel; both flare up easily. Only use crystal clear K-1 kerosene. Never overfill any portable heater or fill when it is still hot.  Only use the kerosene heater in a well-ventilated room. Wood Stoves Wood stoves cause more than 9,000 residential fires every year.  Carefully follow the manufacturer's installation and maintenance instructions.  Check for cracks and inspect legs, hinges and door seals for smooth joints and seams. Use only seasoned wood for fuel, not green wood, artificial logs or trash. Inspect and clean your pipes and chimneys annually, and check monthly for damage or obstructions. Be sure to keep combustible objects at least 3 feet away from your wood stove. Wood Burning Fireplaces Fireplaces regularly build up creosote in their chimneys. Fireplaces need to be cleaned out frequently, and chimneys should be inspected for obstructions and cracks to prevent deadly chimney and roof fires.  Check to make sure the damper is open before starting any fire. Never burn trash, paper or green wood in your fireplace. These materials cause heavy creosote build-up and are difficult to control. Use a screen heavy enough to stop rolling logs and big enough to cover the entire opening of the fireplace to prevent sparks from igniting carpet, furniture or other combustible items. Don't wear loose-fitting clothes near any open flame. Make sure the fire is completely out before leaving the house or going to bed. Store cooled ashes in a tightly sealed metal container outside the home. For more information, visit ourChimney and Fireplace Safety page.

Studies show that in December, an average of 25 people a day will die in drunk driving incidents. Longer-term data suggest that traffic fatalities do tend to spike around Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s and the July 4th holidays. The deadliest days for pedestrians are Halloween and New Year’s Day, while DUI incidents tend to spike during Spring Break. Some people persist in drinking and driving based on myths about how the body reacts to alcohol and its ability to overcome alcohol’s effects. Scientific studies supported by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) provide important information that belies two commonly held beliefs about drinking and driving: of intoxication are visible. In addition, the sedative effects of alcohol, combined with late-night hours, place you at much greater risk of nodding off or losing attention behind the wheel. Alcohol-related incidents don’t just affect traffic accident victims. Party hosts have been held legally liable for drunk driving incidents that occur after intoxicated individuals leave their homes. “Social host liability” laws, which allow anyone injured by an intoxicated individual who got drunk or high at their party to sue the party host/homeowner, vary by state.

This radioactive gas can be detected in homes, offices and schools; it enters buildings through cracks in floors and walls, construction joints or gaps around service pipes, electrical wires and sump pits. (Contrary to popular belief, granite countertops are usually no more a source of radon than other common household items, such as dishes.)When radon exceeds acceptable levels, the result can be deadly. Scientists estimate 15,000 to 22,000 lung cancer deaths in the U.S. each year are related to radon.People who breathe in radioactive particles, swallow water with high radon levels or are exposed to radon for a long period of time are susceptible to lung damage and lung cancer. The Environmental Protection Agency says nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in America is estimated to have elevated radon levels. How Do You Know if You’re at Risk? The EPA reports elevated radon levels have been measured in every state. Everyone is at some risk. Smokers who are exposed to elevated levels of radon are at higher risk of developing lung cancer.Testing is the only way to determine how much radon is present in your home or drinking water. Short-term (3- to 4-day) and long-term (3- to 12-month) test kits are available. In some cases, manufacturers of these kits will conduct analysis and post results online.The EPA has created this web page to help youfind a radon test kit or measurement and mitigation professional near you. Do-it-yourself test kits also are available at many local hardware stores. How Much Is Too Much? No level of radon exposure is considered completely safe, however the EPA only recommends reducing radon levels in your home if your long-term exposure averages 4 picocuries per liter (pCI/L) or higher. A pCI is a measure of the rate of radioactive decay of radon gas. (These are the tiny particles that can get trapped in your lungs when you breathe.) Reducing Radon in Your Home The American Cancer society says a variety of methods can be used to reduce radon levels in your home, including sealing cracks in floors and walls and increasing ventilation though sub-slab depressurization using pipes and fans.The EPA recommends using a state or nationally certified contractor because lowering high radon levels often requires technical expertise and special skills.

Following these steps should give you some peace of mind while you’re away: Outside Bring in all lawn furniture, ladders and stackable boxes.Unhook all outside hoses so they don’t freeze.Trim all plants and bushes so all doors and windows are easily seen from the street.Empty trash cans = empty house. Put trash cans inside or have a neighbor use yours each week. Lights Install motion-sensor lights in the front and back of your house. Position the lights so they will detect anyone approaching from the side of your house. Install the lights up high so someone cannot unscrew the bulb or block the light.Make sure your light bulbs are working before you leave on vacation.Use a timer for lights, radios and televisions. Time each to turn on randomly in different rooms throughout the entire day. Inside Turn off your hot water heater, water to your washing machine and water to your dishwasher.  If any of the connections fail on these appliances, it could flood your entire house.Move items off the floor and/or away from basement windows in case of natural or appliance flooding.Discard any perishable items in your refrigerator and freezer.  Have someone check periodically to make sure the power doesn’t go out.  It’d be quite unpleasant to return to a refrigerator full of rotting food!Store valuables in places or other locations that a burglar could not access  (i.e., take jewelry to a safe-deposit box, lock computers in closets, hide keys to extra cars, etc.).  Be sure to remove all valuables from sight, especially if a thief looks in through your windows.Take photographs or videos of all expensive items.  This is helpful for both the police and the insurance agency (if you have a homeowner's policy), to identify the stolen goods.Use an engraving pen to mark these items with some kind of personal identifying information, such as your initials, in an inconspicuous place. This also helps record your possessions in case of any other mishap, such as fire or flood.Turn the ringers off on any telephones, so thieves can’t hear if no one is home to answer the phone.Don’t leave a message on the answering machine that tells callers you’re out of town.  Instead, say you’re away from the phone and you’ll get back to them. Windows Make sure that all windows are closed and locked before leaving.  In basement windows, install a metal grate or a steel bar in window track to deter burglars.Don’t draw all of the curtains and/or blinds closed. This signals that no one is home. Garage Lock all doors leading into the house. This way, if someone opens the garage door, they’ll be unable to gain access to the house.Cover garage windows with blinds so people can’t see valuables in the garage. Also, install a padlock on track garage doors, so thieves can’t use a crowbar to open them.Unplug your automatic garage-door opener. Services Arrange for a neighbor to: park their car in your driveway, and check for extra newspapers, flyers and packages. Give your neighbor your contact information.Arrange for someone to mow your lawn and shovel your walkways.Give your household plants to a friend or family member to water and take care of.Hold your mail or have a mail service send it to you at your snowbird destination.Hold newspaper delivery a few days before leaving to ensure that it stops.Stop your trash service.Some police departments have vacation check programs. Notify them, and generally they will do a routine check of the house. While some will only drive by and look for suspicious activity, some will get out of their vehicles and inspect the grounds looking for any break-ins. If contact information is left with the police, they can phone the homeowners if there has been a break-in or disturbance. Upon return, they will usually send a card, listing dates and patrol times. Companies to contact with your new address Whether you have a friend get your mail, the post office hold your mail, or a company forward your mail, it’s important that you RECEIVE your mail!  Don’t forget to contact these companies with your new change of address: Source:iSnowbird Meemic Insurance Company provides insurance for teachers and educators in Michigan.

Statistics show that boating fatalities increased from 2013 to 2014 (610 deaths in 2014) as did the number of reported injuries. The reports also reveal some other disturbing facts: Here are some simple tips boat owners and their passengers can take to ensure their safety while enjoying recreational boating: Wear your life jacket As evidenced above, wearing a life jacket is the single most important thing you can do to ensure your safety on the water. And it doesn't matter how great of a swimmer you are, you should still wear a life jacket! Take boating safety courses Boat owners, operators and passengers should complete courses offered by the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and others. The Coast Guard Auxiliary encourages everyone who might be put in a position of having to take command due to incapacity of the owner/operator to take a basic safety course. America’s Boating Course (ABC) is an electronic, basic boating course produced through a partnership between the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and the United States Power Squadrons. It’s available online atwww.AmericasBoatingCourse.com. Get a free Vessel Safety Check Boat owners are encouraged to take advantage of free safety checks offered by the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. It’s your best way to learn about potential problems that might put you in violation of state or federal laws, or — worse — create danger for you or your passengers on the water. Visitwww.vesselsafetycheck.org. Vessel Examiners issue no citations. And there are no penalties for not successfully completing a Vessel Safety Check. Don't drink and boat In the marine environment — motion, vibration, engine noise, sun, wind and spray intensify the effect of alcohol and drugs. These “stressors” cause fatigue — and dramatically affect a boat operator’s coordination, judgment, vision and reaction time. Levels of blood alcohol or medications that would have little impact on land can potentially cause a much greater degree of impairment for the operator of a boat. So never boat under the influence! Watch the skies Make sure you monitor the weather forecast and leave a float plan with someone on shore who can call the Coast Guard if you are overdue.  A “float plan” will give details of your expected location and timing in order to assist any potential search and rescue operations that might be necessary should you run into trouble.  Leave such a plan with someone dependable. Be wary of fire Proper Coast Guard-approved fire extinguishers should be strategically placed on board the boat.  It makes sense to place more than required for the size of the vessel.  Put them in the rear (stern) and bow, as well as at the helm, for example.  The idea is to avoid having the extinguisher on the other side of the fire. Stock up Properly equip your boat with safety devices such as a first aid kit, flares, a tool kit, spare parts, a flashlight, navigation lights, and a whistle, horn or bell. Before setting out, review your insurance coverages with your agent.  While canoes, small sail boats and boats equipped with motors that are less than 25 mph are generally covered under a homeowners or renters insurance policy, larger and faster boats (including jet skis and wave runners) require a separate boat insurance policy.  A typical policy will cover bodily injury (to others), property damage (for damage to someone else's property), medical payments and theft.  Boat owners may also consider purchasing an umbrella liability policy for additional protection for their car, home and boat. Boating can be an excellent and rewarding recreational activity.  Doing it responsibly will ensure years of smooth sailing.  Anchors away!

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/member-services/safety-information-center/chimney-and-fireplace-safety: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Share This Article: Chimney and Fireplace Safety When smoke travels up a chimney, some of it condenses into creosote, which is a tar-like substance that will build up over time. The creosote sticks to the flue and creates a major fire hazard in the chimney as it builds up.If a fire occurs in a chimney, there are extremely high temperatures that will cause the flue to crack. Any cracks in a chimney will create serious health threats for family members because of the carbon monoxide that is drawn into the home. This substance is normally supposed to be vented out through the chimney. It is a colorless and odorless gas that can be deadly for family members and pets. Chimneys should be inspected professionally every year and should also be cleaned by a professional at least once every year. The National Fire Protection Association has created several levels of inspection, which resulted in the NFPA 211 code. It is a standard for fireplaces, chimneys, appliances that burn solid fuel and vents. The NFPA 211 is the standard that all certified chimney sweeps use whenever they are hired to clean chimneys. Level I Inspection This level of inspection is recommended when a chimney is easy to access and the homeowner plans to maintain it as is. During a Level I inspection, the chimney sweep will verify that the structure of the chimney is sound and that is also free of obstructions or creosote. Level II Inspection If a new heating appliance has been added or an existing one has been modified to burn a different type of fuel, the chimney must have this type of inspection. This level of inspection is also necessary after a property has been sold or if something happened that would have probably caused damage to the chimney. Level II inspections include the same points covered in the previous level as well as crawl spaces, basements and parts of attics. In some cases, this type of inspection may also include performance tests such as pressure or smoke tests. An interior video inspection of the chimney may be conducted if it is deemed necessary. Level III Inspection If the previous levels’ inspections result in the suggestion of a hidden hazard and evaluations cannot be performed without accessing areas that are concealed, this type of inspection is necessary. It verifies proper construction and conditions of any portions of the chimney and flue that are concealed. Level III inspections may be necessary if an incident damaged a building to the point its chimney had to be inspected.Annual inspections are important, but it is also helpful to consider purchasing a metal chimney liner. These liners are designed to protect the inside of the chimney from corrosion, which is the result of combustion byproducts building up. Chimney liners are made from aluminum or stainless steel and may be used for repairing existing chimneys. These items are U.L. tested, so they are both safe and durable if they are installed and maintained properly. For chimneys over gas, oil or wood-burning units, stainless steel liners are used. Aluminum is only suitable for some gas applications. In addition to the liners, high-temperature insulation must be used to ensure safety. More Fireplace Safety Tips Sitting around a cozy, warm fire can be a wonderful experience for a family. But that experience can quickly turn to tragedy if you don’t follow some simple do’s and don’ts of fireplace safety.After having your fireplace and chimney inspected, there are several other steps you should take before ever lighting a fire: There are also some things you should never do when you light a fire: If a large fire breaks out, act immediately because smoke and flames will spread quickly. You and your family should leave the house at once. Don’t stop to call the fire department and don’t try to extinguish the fire yourself. Fumes overcome most victims long before flames do. If you must go through the smoke to escape, get down on your hands and knees on the floor and crawl with your body as low to the floor as possible. Keep your head about 12-24 inches above the floor. After you and your family are safely out of the house, call the fire department from a neighbor’s home.To ensure your family’s safety, conduct periodic fire drills. Know your safest escape route and be sure you and your family have a designated meeting place outside the house. And finally, practice crawling out of a room so that everyone knows exactly what to do if the need ever arises. Meemic Insurance Company provides insurance for teachers and educators in Michigan.

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/member-services/safety-information-center/stay-safe-around-the-grill: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Share This Article: Stay Safe Around the Grill Whether a person plans to slowly barbecue food or grill it fast, there are several important issues to consider. Grill safety is a hot topic, especially during summer months. Cooking with hot metals, high temperatures, a blazing sun and fuels can be a recipe for disaster if proper safety procedures are not observed. Fire One of the earth's most destructive forces is fire. When using it for a cookout, it is important to have a fire extinguisher handy. People who plan to use grills should also know how to properly control a fire. Thousands of fires are caused every year by smokers or grills, and there are also hundreds of injuries. Learn how to safely cut fuel supplies when necessary, how to call the fire department and how to extinguish fires quickly. One person should be in charge of watching the fire at all times. Also, learn how to treat burns properly with first aid. Smoke Smoke contains cancer-causing substances, so it is best to avoid direct contact with it a much as possible. Stand a safe distance from the grill between tasks. People can also share grill duties to avoid having one person exposed to smoke for a prolonged period. Charcoal Contrary to popular belief, charcoal grills cause more fires than gas grills. One of the biggest causes of problems and injuries is using lighter fluid on a charcoal grill. There are better ways to light charcoals. Using match-light charcoal is one option, but be sure to store it in a cool, dry place away from the sun. Another option is to use a charcoal chimney starter. With these, wadded newspapers are put in the bottom with the coals on the top rack. The burning paper heats the coals and the sides of the unit. When the coals are ready, they are dumped or released onto the grill rack. This eliminates the need for lighter fluid. Gas Safety With gas grills, the main cause of fires is fuel path obstruction. An obstruction usually exists under, behind or in the grill where a person would not look. Bugs and debris can wedge into places that cause obstructions, so it is important to keep a gas grill as clean as possible at all times. When it is not in use, cover it. At the first sign of any problem, turn the gas off and wait for the unit to cool to look for problems. Disconnect the gas source properly when attempting any repairs. Grease Fuel used for grilling causes enough of a risk, but meats also contain fat that causes flare-ups. When cooking with fatty meats, be sure to wear grill gloves. Do not wear a standard baking mitt, because these can catch fire. Use items that are designed for cooking with a grill. Be sure to clean the grill regularly. Grease builds up in it over time and can become thick enough that it will create a hazard. These fires can also happen in smokers, so the same rules apply for those as well. Food Safety Bacteria will eat any food and can grow in any temperature above freezing or below 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Until food is ready to be put on the grill or eaten, it needs to be kept cool or hot. Refrigerate meats before cooking, and keep them on the warmer section of the grill until they are ready to be served. For pork, make sure the internal temperature is at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Food poisoning is more likely to happen to people than getting the flu, so food safety is very important. Other Tips Be sure to keep grills and smokers away from homes and garages. They should be far enough away from exterior walls that a fire cannot spread. Also, do not place them close to shrubs or under trees that hang low. A long-term safety issue is cancer. Charring the outside of meat frequently can be a contributing factor. It is better to cook meats at lower temperatures or use marinades to reduce this problem.

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/member-services/safety-information-center/hail-storms: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Share This Article: What You Need to Know About Hail Hail is a form of precipitation that occurs when updrafts in thunderstorms carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere, where they freeze into balls of ice. Hail can damage aircraft, homes and cars, and can be deadly to livestock and people. How does hail form? Hailstones grow by colliding with supercooled water drops. Supercooled water will freeze on contact with ice crystals, frozen raindrops, dust or some other nuclei. Thunderstorms that have a strong updraft keep lifting the hailstones up to the top of the cloud, where they encounter more supercooled water and continue to grow. The hail falls when the thunderstorm's updraft can no longer support the weight of the ice, or the updraft weakens. The stronger the updraft, the larger the hailstone can grow.Hailstones can have layers like an onion if they travel up and down in an updraft, or they can have few or no layers if they are “balanced” in an updraft. One can tell how many times a hailstone traveled to the top of the storm by counting the layers. Hailstones can begin to melt and then re-freeze together, forming large and very irregularly shaped hail. How does hail fall to the ground? Hail falls when it becomes heavy enough to overcome the strength of the updraft and is pulled by gravity towards the earth. How it falls is dependent on what is going on inside the thunderstorm. Hailstones bump into other raindrops and other hailstones inside the thunderstorm, and this bumping slows down their fall. Drag and friction also slow their fall. If the winds are strong enough, they can even blow hail so that it falls at an angle. This would explain why the screens on one side of a house can be shredded by hail and the rest are unharmed. What areas have the most hail? Though Florida has the most thunderstorms, Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming usually have the most hail storms. The area where these three states meet – “hail alley,” averages seven to nine hail days per year. The reason why this area gets so much hail is that the freezing levels (the area of the atmosphere at 32 degrees or less) in the high plains are much closer to the ground than they are at sea level, where hail has plenty of time to melt before reaching the ground. Other parts of the world that have damaging hailstorms include China, Russia, India and northern Italy.When viewed from the air, it is evident that hail falls in paths known as hail swaths. They can range in size from a few acres to an area 10 miles wide and 100 miles long. Piles of hail in hail swaths have been so deep, a snow plow was required to remove them, and occasionally, hail drifts have been reported. How large can hail get? Hail is usually pea-sized to marble-sized, but big thunderstorms can produce big hail. The largest hailstone recovered in the U.S. fell in Vivian, SD, on June 23, 2010, with a diameter of 8 inches and a circumference of 18.62 inches. It weighed 1 lb 15 oz.Hail size is estimated by comparing it to a known object. Most hail storms are made up of a mix of sizes, and only the very largest hail stones pose serious risk to people caught in the open. Why does the sky look green during some hail storms? Scientists don't agree on why the sky may appear green during severe weather, although there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that it can mean hail may be nearby.  One theory is that large amounts of water and ice in a severe thunderstorm will scatter green light during the strong updrafts that occur in severe storms. Does a hailstorm mean there could also be a tornado? Not always, but possibly.  Since large hail often appears near the area within a thunderstorm where tornadoes are most likely to form, you should assume a tornado could be nearby and seek appropriate shelter. Where can I find data on hail storms? TheNational Climatic Data Centeris the official archive for all U.S. weather events. Specific data sets can be found in theU.S. Storms Event Database.

From 2009 through 2011, there was an average of about 1,300 cooking fires on Thanksgiving Day. This is more than three times the average daily rate from 2009 through 2011 of about 400 cooking fires a day.“As fire safety experts have said for years, ‘Stand by your pan!’ ” said former CPSC Chairwoman Inez Tenenbaum. “If you are frying, grilling or broiling food, stay in the kitchen. Not following this advice can be a recipe for disaster on Thanksgiving and throughout the year.”When it comes to fires in the home, cooking fires are No. 1.  They accounted for nearly 150,000 fires (more than 40 percent of all annual unintentional residential fires) each year from 2009 through 2011.  Unattended cooking is the top cause of cooking fires. Cooking fires also caused the most home fire-related injuries, with an estimated annual average of nearly 27 percent, or 3,450 injuries each year.Overall, CPSC estimates an average of 362,300 unintentional residential fires, 2,260 deaths, 12,820 injuries and nearly $7 billion in property damage attended by the fire service occurring each year between 2009 and 2011. Stay Safe in the Kitchen To stay safe in the kitchen, avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing with long sleeves near ranges or ovens, watch children closely so they don’t come into contact with cooking food or hot stovetops, turn pan handles toward the back of the stove to prevent kids and others from spilling a pan’s scalding contents onto themselves. In the event of a fire, call 911. Cover a pan with a lid to smother the flames. Never pour water or flour on a fire. That can make it worse. Keep a fire extinguisher in the kitchen. Be Extra Cautious With Fryers Turkey fryer fires can be explosive and result in serious burns. Only use a turkey fryer outside and away from your home. Never use it in a garage or on a porch. Don’t overfill the oil or leave the turkey fryer unattended. Since 2003, there have been more than 125 turkey fryer-related fires, burns, explosions, smoke inhalations or laceration incidents reported to CPSC staff.  There were 55 injuries among these incidents, but none were fatal.  For the incidents reporting a dollar value for the property loss, the total loss reported was around $6 million.  Additional incidents involving turkey fryers may have occurred that were not reported to CPSC. The Federal Emergency Management Agency lists these five dangers of deep frying a turkey: Avoid Food Poisoning Food poisoning can be another holiday hazard. “Preventing food poisoning also should be an important part of your Thanksgiving festivities,” said USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety Brian Ronholm.  “To ensure your bountiful meal is a success, follow the four key food safety steps – Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill.  Clean utensils and wash your hands before preparing foods, separate raw meats from other foods to avoid cross-contamination, cook your turkey to the right temperature of 165 degrees, and chill the leftovers within an hour so that you can have tasty meals and snacks for the rest of the weekend.”To keep food poisoning from ruining your Thanksgiving, follow these safety tips from the USDA. Wash hands, surfaces, and cooking utensils, but do not wash a turkey — this spreads bacteria onto sinks and countertops. Cooking your Thanksgiving turkey to 165 degrees Fahrenheit is the only way to kill harmful bacteria that can cause foodborne illness.

It's true, and it's a scary reality for parents to face. But there are steps you can take to keep your teen drivers as safe as possible — even when you're not in the car with them. Practice, Practice, Practice The best way to ensure they're good drivers when you're not around is to start by making sure they're good when you are around. So, you should set aside a specific practice day each week — even after they get their license — so you can continue to provide feedback and keep an eye on how they're doing. Just Say No The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration agrees that one of the most important things you can do as a parent is limit your teen driver's distractions and risks. That means making sure they know that when they're behind the wheel, it's always no phone, no speeding and no drugs or alcohol. Limit the Number of Passengers Having just one teen passenger in the car increases your teen's risk of having an accident by 44%. And if that passenger is a sibling, the distractions could be even greater than if it's a friend. If possible, keep young passengers out of the car while your teen is driving for at least a year. They Notice When You Buckle Up Maybe they're not always great at listening to what you say, but your teens do notice what you do. In fact, research shows that parents who wear seatbelts have children who wear seatbelts — and, if your teen is in a crash, that seatbelt could make a life or death difference. Know the Laws Did you know that, in Michigan, teen drivers can be fined for using a phone while driving — even if it's hands-free — unless it's to report an accident, a crime or an emergency? Michigan has specific Graduated Driver Licensing (or GDL) laws that your teen will need to work up through before gaining full driving privileges. The Car Can Make All the Difference You don't want to break the bank on your teen's first car — but you want to make sure you're keeping them as safe as possible. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety publishes a list of safe and affordable vehicles that can help you make the best choice for your child. Put It in Writing Make your teen commit to the safe driving rules you set by having them sign a contract—and make sure there are consequences when they don't follow the rules. You'll find a lot of contracts already written for you by searching online, or you can create your own. Understand the Risks One of the best ways to get your teen drivers off to a safe start is by discussing the risks with them. The numbers don't lie — car crashes are the #1 cause of teen death in the U.S.Download and print this infographicto help you talk to your teen about the dangers they'll face on the road.

See What Our Members Are Saying For 69 years, Meemic has always been there for us when we needed them. Joyce A. I believe in community. I believe in the give and take of community. I believe in putting my actions where my heart is. I know my insurance premium doesn’t directly pay for the Meemic Foundation grants, but I know that it helps to fund them. And I saved money in the process! Mary C. I felt Meemic took a personal interest in us. I loved that we had two touchpoints that we worked with the whole time, and we had direct contact to both of them. Meemic personified the personal touch that we needed at that time. We never were left on hold, transferred, and there was good communication between the two of them. The process was smooth! Jennifer F.

            " Skipping https://dev1.meemic.com/75years: Input Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Resources Meemic Celebrates 75 Years! As we celebrate our 75th anniversary milestone, we honor the people and relationships that make our workplace feel like family—our employees, agents, and, of course, our valued Meemic Members. A Journey Through Time: Meemic’s Milestones and Moments What began with a small group of teachers in Detroit, known as The Detroit Teachers Group, has blossomed into the Meemic we know today. While there’s much to share about our company’s evolution—from our Detroit roots to our expansion in Auburn Hills and beyond—let’s focus on the key moments that have defined us.  M.E.E.M.I.C originally stood for Michigan Educational Employees Mutual Insurance Company, but now, we are simply known as Meemic. Over time, we’ve broadened our offerings, adding homeowners and other insurance lines to our portfolio.  A pivotal moment for us came in 1992 with the founding of The Meemic Foundation for the Future of Education. The Meemic Foundation has made an incredible impact over the years. Just since 2015, it has awarded over 25,000 grants valued in the millions to support educators and classrooms.  The heart of our story has always been the people: our dedicated educators and school employees, and the passionate team of agents and employees who’ve helped us navigate every challenge and triumph. What started as a company serving teachers continues to thrive with that same commitment today.  Many of our agents are current or former educators, some come from families of teachers, and others have passed their agencies down through generations. It’s no surprise that a company founded in education has created bonds that continue to resonate across generations. 75 Years of Growth: From Our First Headquarters to Today First Meemic Headquarters in Detroit, MI Current Meemic Headquarters in Auburn Hills, MI Meemic Insurance Company provides insurance for teachers and educators in Michigan.

If you’re at fault for an accident, this coverage pays for the value of another person’s injury or damage to another person’s property up to the elected/purchased policy limits. If another driver is at fault in an accident and doesn’t have enough coverage to pay for damages, this coverage will help with your costs. This coverage helps pay for damage to your vehicle caused by a rollover or contact with another vehicle or object regardless of who’s at fault.
